paper_pdf: Unknown Journal Link

claim_type: "pip_libraries"

data_url: ''
claims:
- claim: The calculated lattice constant of the intrinsic monolayer SnS2 is a=b=3.70
    Å and the S-Sn bond length is 2.607 Å.
  instruction:
  - Construct a monolayer SnS2 unit cell
  - 'DFT setup in CASTEP (Material Studio): - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional
    (GGA) - Pseudopotentials: Not specified (likely ultrasoft or norm-conserving)
    - K-points: 6x6x1 Monkhorst-Pack grid - Plane-wave cutoff energy: 400 eV - Energy
    convergence: 1.0e-5 eV - Force convergence: 0.01 eV/Å - Vacuum layer: 15 Å'
  - Perform geometry optimization
  - Extract lattice parameters and bond lengths
  - 'Expected result: a=b=3.70 Å, S-Sn bond length = 2.607 Å'
- claim: The adsorption energy of Mg at the TS site (above S atom) of S-vacancy SnS2
    is -2.431 eV.
  instruction:
  - Construct a 3x3x1 supercell of monolayer SnS2 (27 atoms)
  - Create an S vacancy
  - Place Mg atom at the TS site above the S atom
  - Use the same DFT setup as in the previous claim (CASTEP, PBE, etc.)
  - Relax the atomic positions
  - Calculate adsorption energy using E_ads = E(Mg/S-vacancy SnS2) - E(S-vacancy SnS2)
    - E(Mg)
  - 'Expected result: -2.431 eV'
- claim: Intrinsic monolayer SnS2 is an indirect bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap
    value of 1.574 eV.
  instruction:
  - Use the optimized structure of monolayer SnS2
  - Use the same DFT setup as previous claims
  - Perform a band structure calculation along the high-symmetry path (not explicitly
    specified in the paper, but likely G-M-K-G based on the description)
  - Extract the VBM and CBM values
  - 'Expected result: Indirect band gap of 1.574 eV'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: The absorption and reflection peaks of the S-vacancy SnS2 adsorption system
    with Mg atoms were red-shifted and appeared in the ultraviolet region as compared
    to the intrinsic SnS2.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: While the paper presents the absorption
    and reflection spectra, the precise numerical values for peak positions and shifts
    are not provided, making quantitative reproduction difficult.'
- claim: This improves the utilization of the adsorption system for ultraviolet light
    to a great extent.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: This is a qualitative interpretation
    of the results and requires further analysis and potentially experimental validation.'
