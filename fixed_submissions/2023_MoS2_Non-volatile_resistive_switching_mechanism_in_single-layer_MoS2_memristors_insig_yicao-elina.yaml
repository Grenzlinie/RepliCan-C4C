claims:
- claim: The adhesion energy of pristine single-layer MoS2 on Au(111) is -0.34 eV
    per surface Au atom.
  instruction:
  - Construct a 3x3 orthorhombic MoS2 supercell (a = 9.4812 Å, b = 9.4812 Å) and a
    Au(111) surface with a lattice constant adjusted to match MoS2 (inducing ~3% strain
    in Au)
  - Create the Au/MoS2 interface by placing the MoS2 layer on top of the Au(111) surface,
    ensuring a van der Waals gap. The interface supercell dimensions are a = 16.4219
    Å, b = 9.4812 Å, and c = 45.5679 Å
  - 'DFT setup in QuantumATK: - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional - Pseudopotentials:
    Norm-conserving from PseudoDojo library - Basis set: QuantumATK-optimized Medium
    basis set - Density-mesh cutoff: 150 Ry - K-points: 2x3 Monkhorst-Pack grid for
    geometry optimization - Dispersion correction: Grimme D2 - Green''s function surface
    model for Au electrode (6 Au layers, Dirichlet boundary conditions towards bulk
    Au, Neumann boundary conditions towards vacuum, 138 k-points along Au electrode
    direction)'
  - Relax atomic positions until forces < 0.05 eV/Å
  - Calculate adhesion energy using equation (1) in the paper, including counterpoise
    correction for BSSE
  - 'Expected result: -0.34 eV per surface Au atom'
- claim: Introducing a single sulfur vacancy (2.7% defect density) does not significantly
    change the adhesion energy (-0.34 eV).
  instruction:
  - Follow steps 1-3 from the previous claim
  - Remove one S atom from the MoS2 supercell to create a single S vacancy
  - Follow steps 4-5 from the previous claim
  - 'Expected result: -0.34 eV per surface Au atom'
- claim: Filling the sulfur vacancy with a gold atom increases the adhesion energy
    to -0.42 eV.
  instruction:
  - Follow steps 1-3 from the first claim
  - Remove one S atom and replace it with a Au atom
  - Follow steps 4-5 from the first claim
  - 'Expected result: -0.42 eV per surface Au atom'
- claim: The tunnelling probability for the pristine interface is close to 40%.
  instruction:
  - Follow steps 1-4 from the first claim
  - Calculate the plane-averaged effective potential (Veff) across the interface
  - Determine the tunnelling barrier height (FTB) and width (DL) from the Veff plot
  - Calculate the tunnelling probability (T) using equation (2) in the paper
  - 'Expected result: ~40%'
- claim: MoS2 with 11% substitutional Au defects shows metallization.
  instruction:
  - Follow steps 1-3 from the first claim
  - Introduce four Au atoms substituting S atoms in the MoS2 supercell (11% defect
    density)
  - Follow step 4 from the first claim
  - Perform a DOS calculation with a denser k-point grid (8x12 Monkhorst-Pack)
  - Analyze the projected DOS (PDOS) onto Mo-4d and S-3p orbitals. The presence of
    states crossing the Fermi level indicates metallization
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: The device retained its properties even after several bending cycles, making
    it suitable to be used in flexible electronics.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Requires device fabrication and mechanical
    bending tests.'
- claim: The atomristor has been shown to function at low voltages (#1 V), thus having
    the great advantage of being low-power while enabling denser system integration.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Requires device fabrication and electrical
    measurements.'
- claim: Raman spectroscopy confirms N incorporation
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: Requires experimental Raman measurements'
- claim: Device mobility increases by 20%
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Requires device fabrication and electrical
    measurements'
