claims:
- claim: Interactions open a gap at filling ν = 1, stabilizing an isolated |C| = 1
    Chern band with a bandwidth of 6 meV in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene with
    hBN substrate at twist angle θ = 0.77° and displacement field uD = 50 meV.
  instruction:
  - 'Construct the Hamiltonian for rhombohedral pentalayer graphene (NL=5) with hBN
    moiré potential as described in Appendix A of the paper.  This includes: - Kinetic
    term with intralayer hopping t0 = 3.1 eV, interlayer hopping t1 = 380 meV, and
    higher order hoppings t2 = -21 meV, t3 = 290 meV, t4 = 141 meV. - Displacement
    field term with uD = 50 meV. - hBN moiré potential with V0 = 28.9 meV, V1 = 21
    meV, ψ = -0.29, and twist angle θ = 0.77°'
  - Include Coulomb interactions screened by gates at distance d = 250 Å and dielectric
    constant εr = 5
  - 'Perform self-consistent Hartree-Fock (SCHF) calculations: - Project onto the
    lowest 7 conduction bands. - Assume spin and valley polarization. - Use a Monkhorst-Pack
    k-point grid with at least 24x24 moiré unit cells. Ensure convergence with respect
    to k-point sampling and number of bands (see Appendix B)'
  - Calculate the band structure and Berry curvature of the occupied bands
  - 'Expected result: An isolated Chern band with |C| = 1 and a bandwidth of approximately
    6 meV'
- claim: A Laughlin state appears at ν = 2/3 of the AHC band.
  instruction:
  - Obtain the self-consistent Hartree-Fock (SCHF) solution at ν=1 as described in
    the previous claim
  - Project the interacting Hamiltonian onto the lowest SCHF band (the Chern band)
  - Perform exact diagonalization (ED) calculations on a finite-size system (e.g.,
    4x6 moiré unit cells) at ν = 2/3 filling of the Chern band
  - Alternatively, perform density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations
    on an infinite cylinder geometry (e.g., Ly=8) at ν = 2/3 filling
  - Analyze the many-body spectrum and entanglement spectrum (for DMRG) for signatures
    of a Laughlin state (e.g., threefold ground state degeneracy, spectral flow, characteristic
    entanglement spectrum degeneracies)
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: Experimental validations of the QAH and FQAH states.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: Requires experimental measurements
    on rhombohedral pentalayer graphene devices.'
- claim: The AHC state is the true ground state beyond mean-field theory.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: While SCHF provides evidence for
    the AHC, confirming it requires more sophisticated methods beyond the scope of
    the paper, such as variational Monte Carlo.'
