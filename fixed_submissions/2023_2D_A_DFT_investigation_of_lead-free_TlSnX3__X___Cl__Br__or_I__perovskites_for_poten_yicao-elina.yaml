claims:
- claim: TlSnCl3, TlSnBr3, and TlSnI3 perovskites exhibit direct band gaps (R / R)
    of 0.87 eV, 0.52 eV, and 0.28 eV, respectively, using the GGA-PBE functional.
  instruction:
  - Create a unit cell of TlSnX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) in a cubic structure with space group
    Pm-3m (number 221). Tl at (0, 0, 0), Sn at (0.5, 0.5, 0.5), and X at (0.5, 0.5,
    0), (0.5, 0, 0.5), and (0, 0.5, 0.5)
  - 'DFT setup in Quantum Espresso: - Exchange-correlation: GGA-PBE functional - K-points:
    6×6×6 for self-consistent calculation, 12×12×12 for non-self-consistent calculation.
    - Kinetic energy cutoff: 50 Ry - Charge density cutoff: 500 Ry - Total energy
    convergence threshold: 10⁻⁸ Ry'
  - Relax the unit cell to obtain optimized lattice parameters
  - Perform non-self-consistent calculation using the optimized lattice parameters
  - Calculate the band structure along the R-R path
  - Extract the band gap values
  - 'Expected results: TlSnCl3 = 0.87 eV, TlSnBr3 = 0.52 eV, TlSnI3 = 0.28 eV.  Note:
    PBE underestimates band gaps'
- claim: TlSnCl3, TlSnBr3, and TlSnI3 have formation energies of -3.11 eV, -2.79 eV,
    and -2.44 eV, respectively.
  instruction:
  - Use the relaxed structures from the previous band structure calculation
  - Calculate the total energy of the TlSnX3 unit cell (Etot(TlSnX3))
  - Calculate the energy of isolated Tl (E(Tl)), Sn (E(Sn)), and X (E(X)) atoms
  - 'Calculate formation energy using the equation: ΔEf = Etot(TlSnX3) - E(Tl) - E(Sn)
    - 3E(X)'
  - 'Expected results: TlSnCl3 = -3.11 eV, TlSnBr3 = -2.79 eV, TlSnI3 = -2.44 eV'
- claim: TlSnCl3 has the highest bulk modulus (22.99 GPa), followed by TlSnBr3 (19.70
    GPa) and TlSnI3 (15.59 GPa).
  instruction:
  - Use the relaxed structures from the band structure calculation
  - Calculate the elastic constants (C11, C12, C44) using the thermo_pw program in
    Quantum Espresso
  - 'Calculate the bulk modulus (B) using the equation: B = (C11 + 2*C12)/3'
  - 'Expected results: TlSnCl3 = 22.99 GPa, TlSnBr3 = 19.70 GPa, TlSnI3 = 15.59 GPa'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: These materials exhibit considerable potential for utilization in solar cells.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Requires further calculations and
    simulations beyond basic DFT to assess solar cell performance.'
- claim: The evaluation of their thermoelectric properties has revealed the highly
    promising potential of these materials to be employed in thermoelectric applications.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Requires further analysis and simulations
    beyond basic DFT calculations to fully evaluate thermoelectric device performance.'
- claim: The perovskites demonstrated remarkable optical properties, particularly
    a high absorption coefficient, ranging from 10⁵ cm⁻¹ to 10⁶ cm⁻¹.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: While the optical properties were
    calculated, the specific range of 10⁵ cm⁻¹ to 10⁶ cm⁻¹ is not explicitly given
    in the provided data.  The absorption coefficient plot is provided, but extracting
    precise numerical values requires digitizing the graph.'
