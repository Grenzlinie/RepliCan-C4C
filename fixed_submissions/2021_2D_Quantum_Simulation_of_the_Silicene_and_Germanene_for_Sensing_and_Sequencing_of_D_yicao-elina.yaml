claims:
- claim: The binding energy of Guanine (G) on silicene is -1.35 eV.
  instruction:
  - Construct a silicene monolayer
  - Place a Guanine molecule on the silicene surface, considering different adsorption
    sites (hollow, top, bridge, valley) and orientations (parallel, tilted)
  - 'Perform geometry optimization using DFT with the SIESTA code. - Exchange-correlation
    functional: PBE-GGA - Pseudopotentials: Norm-conserving - Basis set: Linear combination
    of numerical atomic orbitals (LCNAO) - k-points: 3x3x1 for relaxation - Mesh cutoff:
    300 Ry - Van der Waals correction: Grimme-D2 - Force tolerance: 0.04 eV/Ã…'
  - 'Calculate the binding energy using the formula: E_binding = E_monolayer+NB -
    (E_monolayer + E_NB)'
  - 'Expected result: -1.35 eV'
- claim: The binding energy of Guanine (G) on germanene is -1.30 eV.
  instruction:
  - Construct a germanene monolayer
  - Follow steps 2-4 from the previous instruction, replacing silicene with germanene
  - 'Expected result: -1.30 eV'
- claim: The binding energy of Li on silicene is -2.51 eV.
  instruction:
  - Construct a silicene monolayer
  - Place a Li atom on the silicene surface, considering different adsorption sites
  - Follow steps 3-4 from the first instruction, replacing Guanine with Li
  - 'Expected result: -2.51 eV'
- claim: The binding energy of Li on germanene is -2.55 eV.
  instruction:
  - Construct a germanene monolayer
  - Follow steps 2-4 from the previous instruction, replacing silicene with germanene
  - 'Expected result: -2.55 eV'
- claim: Adsorption of Guanine (G) and Cytosine (C) on silicene opens a band gap.
  instruction:
  - Use the relaxed structures of Guanine and Cytosine adsorbed on silicene from the
    binding energy calculations
  - 'Perform band structure calculations using DFT with the SIESTA code. - k-points:
    9x9x1 for band structure'
  - Analyze the band structure for the presence of a band gap
- claim: Adsorption of Guanine (G) and Cytosine (C) on germanene opens a band gap.
  instruction:
  - Use the relaxed structures of Guanine and Cytosine adsorbed on germanene from
    the binding energy calculations
  - Follow step 2 from the previous instruction
  - Analyze the band structure for the presence of a band gap
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: Sensitivity analysis for DNA/RNA nucleobase sequencing using silicene and
    germanene biosensors.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Requires extensive calculations of
    transmission at various gate voltages and comparison with experimental conductance
    measurements, which are beyond the scope of a simple reproduction exercise.'
- claim: STM images can be used to identify nucleobases on silicene/germanene.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: Requires experimental STM measurements.'
