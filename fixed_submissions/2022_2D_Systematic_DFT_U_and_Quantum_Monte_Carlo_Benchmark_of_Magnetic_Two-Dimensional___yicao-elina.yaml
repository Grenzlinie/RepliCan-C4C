claims:
- claim: CrI3 has the highest degree of magnetic anisotropy (MA) compared to other
    CrX3 materials.
  instruction:
  - Obtain relaxed structures of CrX3 (X = I, Br, Cl, F) monolayers from JARVIS-DFT
    database (optimized with vdW-DF-OptB88)
  - Perform non-collinear spin-orbit DFT+U calculations using VASP with PAW pseudopotentials
  - Calculate energy difference between in-plane and out-of-plane spin orientations
    for both ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) configurations
  - Extract magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) from these calculations
  - Compare MAE values for different CrX3 materials
  - 'Expected result: CrI3 shows the largest MAE'
- claim: The estimated Curie temperature (Tc) for CrI3 is 43.56 K.
  instruction:
  - Obtain relaxed structure of CrI3 monolayer from JARVIS-DFT database (optimized
    with vdW-DF-OptB88)
  - Perform DFT+U calculations with U = 2 eV using Quantum Espresso with norm-conserving
    pseudopotentials to generate trial wavefunctions for QMC
  - Perform VMC and DMC calculations using QMCPACK with a 48-atom supercell for both
    FM and AFM configurations
  - Calculate magnetic exchange parameter J from DMC energy differences
  - Perform non-collinear spin-orbit DFT+U calculations using VASP (HSE06 functional,
    U = 2 eV) to obtain magnetic anisotropy parameters D and 位
  - Use J, D, and 位 in the Torelli and Olsen analytical model to estimate Tc
  - 'Expected result: Tc = 43.56 K'
- claim: The estimated Curie temperature (Tc) for CrBr3 is 20.78 K.
  instruction:
  - Obtain relaxed structure of CrBr3 monolayer from JARVIS-DFT database (optimized
    with vdW-DF-OptB88)
  - Perform DFT+U calculations with U = 2 eV using Quantum Espresso with norm-conserving
    pseudopotentials to generate trial wavefunctions for QMC
  - Perform VMC and DMC calculations using QMCPACK with a 48-atom supercell for both
    FM and AFM configurations
  - Calculate magnetic exchange parameter J from DMC energy differences
  - Perform non-collinear spin-orbit DFT+U calculations using VASP (LDA+U functional,
    U = 2 eV) to obtain magnetic anisotropy parameters D and 位
  - Use J, D, and 位 in the Torelli and Olsen analytical model to estimate Tc
  - 'Expected result: Tc = 20.78 K'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: Room temperature magnetism has been experimentally measured for 2D VSe2 on
    a van der Waals substrate.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: Requires experimental measurements.'
- claim: Tc can be increased by applying strain or by changing the monolayer substrate.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Requires further calculations beyond
    the scope of the current study.'
