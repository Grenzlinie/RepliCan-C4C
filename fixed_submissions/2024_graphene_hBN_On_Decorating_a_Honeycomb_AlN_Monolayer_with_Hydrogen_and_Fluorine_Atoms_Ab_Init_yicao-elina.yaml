claims:
- claim: Pristine h-AlN monolayer has an indirect band gap of 2.60 eV.
  instruction:
  - Create a unit cell of h-AlN with Al at (0, 0, 0) and N at (1/3, 2/3, 0). Lattice
    parameter a = 3.1513 Å, c = 15 Å
  - 'DFT setup in Quantum Espresso: - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional - Pseudopotentials:
    PAW - K-points: Not specified in the text for this specific claim, but likely
    a reasonably dense grid. - Kinetic energy cutoff: Not specified. - Charge density
    cutoff: Not specified'
  - Relax atomic positions
  - Calculate band structure along high-symmetry path (e.g., Γ-M-K-Γ as shown in Figure
    1)
  - Extract VBM and CBM energies
  - 'Expected result: 2.60 eV (indirect)'
- claim: Fully hydrogenated H-AlN-H monolayer has a band gap of 3.231 eV.
  instruction:
  - Create a 2x2x1 supercell of h-AlN
  - Add H atoms to all Al and N sites on opposite sides of the monolayer
  - DFT setup in Quantum Espresso (same as pristine h-AlN calculation)
  - Relax atomic positions
  - Calculate band structure
  - 'Expected result: 3.231 eV'
- claim: Semi-hydrogenated H-NAl (H bonded to N) is metallic.
  instruction:
  - Create a 2x2x1 supercell of h-AlN
  - Add H atoms to all N sites
  - DFT setup in Quantum Espresso (same as pristine h-AlN calculation)
  - Relax atomic positions
  - Calculate band structure
  - 'Expected result: Metallic (band gap = 0 eV)'
- claim: Semi-hydrogenated H-AlN (H bonded to Al) is metallic.
  instruction:
  - Create a 2x2x1 supercell of h-AlN
  - Add H atoms to all Al sites
  - DFT setup in Quantum Espresso (same as pristine h-AlN calculation)
  - Relax atomic positions
  - Calculate band structure
  - 'Expected result: Metallic (band gap = 0 eV)'
- claim: Semi-fluorinated F-AlN (F bonded to Al) has a band gap of 0.164 eV.
  instruction:
  - Create a 2x2x1 supercell of h-AlN
  - Add F atoms to all Al sites
  - DFT setup in Quantum Espresso (same as pristine h-AlN calculation)
  - Relax atomic positions
  - Calculate band structure
  - 'Expected result: 0.164 eV'
- claim: Janus-type F-AlN-H (F bonded to Al, H bonded to N) has a direct band gap
    of 3.914 eV.
  instruction:
  - Create a 2x2x1 supercell of h-AlN
  - Add F atoms to all Al sites on one side and H atoms to all N sites on the other
    side
  - DFT setup in Quantum Espresso (same as pristine h-AlN calculation)
  - Relax atomic positions
  - Calculate band structure
  - 'Expected result: 3.914 eV (direct)'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: Fluorination of AlN was carried out [...] The presence of fluorine atoms
    on the AlN surface was confirmed by SIMS.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: This claim describes an experimental
    procedure and characterization using SIMS, which is not a computational method.'
