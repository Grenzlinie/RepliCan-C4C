claims:
- claim: Electron density isocontours of HOMO and LUMO of the repeat units of the
    polymers were obtained by density functional theory (DFT) using a B97-D3 functional
    and def2-TZVP basis set.
  instruction:
  - Construct the repeat units of polymers P1, P2, P3, and P4 as shown in Figure 1
    of the paper
  - Perform geometry optimization using DFT with the B97-D3 functional and def2-TZVP
    basis set. Explore both cis and trans isomers with respect to rotations about
    the C-C single bonds linking thienothiophene (TT) to DPP
  - Calculate the HOMO and LUMO isocontours for each optimized structure
  - 'Expected result: HOMO isocontours should show delocalization throughout the backbone,
    while LUMO isocontours should show less delocalization'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: The highest conductivity (ùùà) ‚âà700 S cm‚àí1 was exhibited by P4 on doping with
    CF3SO3H.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Reproducing experimental conductivity
    measurements requires specialized equipment and precise experimental conditions.'
- claim: The polymer DPP-EDOT-based polymer containing MEET as side-chains exhibits
    the lowest oxidation potential by cyclic voltammetry (CV).
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: This claim is based on experimental
    cyclic voltammetry measurements.'
- claim: This polymer also shows the strongest intermolecular interactions evidenced
    by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: This claim is based on experimental
    DSC measurements.'
- claim: Raman spectroscopy, in conjunction with scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDS)
    and x-ray diffraction, provides insight into the solid-state microstructure and
    degree of phase separation of the doped polymer films.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: These claims are based on experimental
    characterization techniques.'
- claim: Infrared spectroscopy enables this study to further quantify the degree of
    charge transfer from polymer to dopant.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: This claim is based on experimental
    infrared spectroscopy measurements.'
