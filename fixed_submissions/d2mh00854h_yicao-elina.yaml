claims:
- claim: NPB has a growth exponent b = 0.12 ± 0.06.
  instruction:
  - Prepare crystalline NPB thin films as templates
  - Deposit additional NPB on the templates at various thicknesses at 80°C and 0.1
    Å/s
  - Measure the RMS roughness (σ) of the films using AFM
  - Plot σ versus thickness (T) on a log-log scale
  - Fit the data to the power law σ ∝ T^b
  - The fitted value of b should be 0.12 ± 0.06
- claim: rac-BINAP has an Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier (EES) of 2.9 kcal/mol in the [001]
    direction and 0.2 kcal/mol in the [010] direction.
  instruction:
  - Use LAMMPS with OPLS force field parameters
  - Set up a molecular terrace of rac-BINAP in its (100) orientation
  - Place an ad-molecule on the terrace
  - Perform steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations by pulling the ad-molecule
    along the [001] and [010] directions towards the terrace edge
  - Calculate the free energy profiles for both directions. The difference between
    the descent barrier (E2) and the horizontal barrier (E1) gives the EES
  - The EES should be 2.9 kcal/mol for the [001] direction and 0.2 kcal/mol for the
    [010] direction
- claim: The diffusion coefficient (D) of a-6T on a complete monolayer is an order
    of magnitude larger than those of rac-BINAP, NPB, and TPBi.
  instruction:
  - Use LAMMPS with OPLS force field parameters
  - Set up a complete monolayer of each molecule (a-6T, rac-BINAP, NPB, TPBi) in their
    respective crystal orientations
  - Place a single ad-molecule on the monolayer
  - Run MD simulations for 20 ns under NVT ensemble at 300K
  - Track the trajectory of the ad-molecule's center of mass
  - Calculate the mean squared displacement (MSD) from the trajectory data
  - Determine the diffusion coefficient (D) from the slope of the MSD vs. time plot
  - The D value for a-6T should be at least 10 times larger than the D values for
    rac-BINAP, NPB, and TPBi
