claims:
- claim: GaN–MoS2, GaN–MoSe2, GaN–WS2 and GaN–WSe2 van der Waals heterostructures
    are energetically stable.
  instruction:
  - Optimize the structures of monolayer GaN, MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2
  - Create heterostructures of GaN–MX2 by placing the optimized monolayers on top
    of each other, considering different stacking configurations (as described in
    the paper)
  - 'Relax the atomic positions of the heterostructures using VASP with the following
    parameters: - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional with Grimme D2 vdW correction
    - Pseudopotentials: PAW - Kinetic energy cutoff: 500 eV - Force convergence: 0.001
    eV/Å - Energy convergence: 10^-5 eV - K-points: 6x6x1 for relaxation'
  - 'Calculate the binding energy (Eb) of the heterostructures using the formula:
    Eb = E(GaN–MX2) - E(GaN) - E(MX2), where E represents the total energy of each
    system'
  - A negative binding energy indicates energetic stability. Compare the binding energies
    of different stacking configurations to determine the most stable one
- claim: GaN–MoS2, GaN–MoSe2, and GaN–WSe2 are direct band gap semiconductors, whereas
    GaN–WS2 is an indirect band gap semiconductor.
  instruction:
  - Use the relaxed structures of the heterostructures from the previous claim (most
    stable stacking configuration)
  - 'Perform a self-consistent field (SCF) calculation using VASP with the following
    parameters: - Exchange-correlation: HSE06 functional (for accurate band gaps)
    - Pseudopotentials: PAW - Kinetic energy cutoff: 500 eV - Energy convergence:
    10^-5 eV - K-points: 12x12x1'
  - Calculate the band structure along the high-symmetry path in the Brillouin zone
  - Analyze the band structure to determine the nature and value of the band gap.  The
    VBM and CBM locations will determine whether the gap is direct or indirect
- claim: Type-II band alignment is observed in all heterostructures, except GaN–WSe2
    having type-I.
  instruction:
  - Follow steps 1 and 2 from the previous claim
  - Calculate the weighted band structure to determine the contribution of each layer
    to the VBM and CBM
  - Analyze the weighted band structure to determine the band alignment type. If VBM
    and CBM originate from different layers, it's type-II. If both originate from
    the same layer, it's type-I
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: These heterostructures are energetically favorable for water splitting.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: While band edge positions relative
    to water redox potentials are calculated, this claim requires further calculations/simulations
    of the actual water splitting reaction to be fully computationally reproducible.'
- claim: The photocatalytic behavior of these systems... show that these heterostructures
    are energetically favorable for water splitting.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Requires further calculations beyond
    band alignment to fully assess photocatalytic activity.'
