claims:
- claim: Transition metal dopants are more stable in adsorption sites for MoS2 and
    MoSe2, whereas interstitial sites become more favorable for MoTe2.
  instruction:
  - Create supercells of MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2 monolayers with sufficient size to
    ensure defect-defect distances of at least 10 Å.  The paper suggests using the
    ASE DefectBuilder to create these supercells
  - Introduce transition metal dopants (e.g., those in Figure 2 of the paper) at both
    interstitial and adsorption sites using the ASE DefectBuilder
  - 'DFT setup in VASP: - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional - Pseudopotentials:
    VASP default PAW potentials - K-points: Gamma-point only - Plane wave energy cutoff:
    600 eV - Kinetic energy cutoff: 900 eV - Spin polarization: True'
  - 'Two-stage relaxation: - Stage 1: Relax atomic positions with looser convergence
    criteria (see Table 1 in the paper). - Stage 2: Relax atomic positions with tighter
    convergence criteria (see Table 1 in the paper). Limit each stage to a maximum
    of 20 ionic steps'
  - Calculate formation energies (Ef) for both adsorption and interstitial configurations
  - Calculate Δ (Eq. 3 in the paper) as the difference between the minimum formation
    energies for interstitial and adsorption sites
  - 'Expected result: Positive Δ for MoS2 and MoSe2 (adsorption favored), negative
    Δ for MoTe2 (interstitial favored).  Specific values for each dopant can be compared
    to Figure 2 of the paper'
- claim: Interstitial doping is generally challenging to achieve for s- and p-block
    dopants due to large covalent radii and/or few available electrons for bonding.
  instruction:
  - Create supercells of various 2D materials (see Supplementary Note 2 for the list
    used in the paper) with sufficient size to ensure defect-defect distances of at
    least 10 Å. Use the ASE DefectBuilder
  - Introduce s- and p-block dopants at both interstitial and adsorption sites using
    the ASE DefectBuilder
  - Use the same DFT setup and relaxation procedure as in the previous claim (VASP,
    PBE, Gamma-point, etc.)
  - Calculate formation energies and Δ values
  - 'Expected result: Generally positive Δ values for s- and p-block dopants, indicating
    a preference for adsorption over interstitial doping.  Exceptions may occur for
    smaller dopants like B, C, and N, especially in host materials with larger lattice
    constants'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: The database can be freely downloaded and accessed through its DOI.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: Downloading and analyzing the large
    database is beyond the scope of a simple computational reproduction.'
- claim: A web application of the database will be available where users can interactively
    inspect the relaxed atomic structures.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: The availability and functionality
    of the web application are not guaranteed at the time of this analysis.'
