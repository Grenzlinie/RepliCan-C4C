claims:
- claim: The Au atom prefers to be adsorbed at the top of the S atom of the pristine
    WS2 monolayer, wherein the binding force is calculated as −3.12 eV.
  instruction:
  - Create a 3x3x1 supercell of WS2 monolayer
  - Optimize the pristine WS2 monolayer structure
  - 'Place a single Au atom at three different sites: TH (above the center of the
    hexagonal ring), Tw (at the top of the W atom), and Ts (at the top of the S atom)'
  - Perform geometry optimization for each configuration
  - 'Calculate the binding energy (Ebind) using the formula: Ebind = EAu-WS2 − EAu
    − EWS2, where EAu-WS2, EAu, and EWS2 are the total energies of the Au-WS2 system,
    isolated Au atom, and pristine WS2 monolayer, respectively'
  - Compare the Ebind values for the three different sites. The most negative value
    corresponds to the most stable adsorption site
  - 'Expected result: Ebind at Ts = -3.12 eV'
- claim: The Au-WS2 monolayer behaves by chemisorption upon the introduction of CO
    and HCHO molecules, with the adsorption energies of −0.82 and −1.01 eV, respectively.
  instruction:
  - Use the optimized Au-WS2 structure from the previous calculation
  - 'Place CO and HCHO molecules at various orientations near the Au atom. For CO:
    C-end, O-end, and parallel orientations. For HCHO: C-O bond, C=C bond, and O-end
    orientations'
  - Perform geometry optimization for each configuration
  - 'Calculate the adsorption energy (Ead) using the formula: Ead = EAu-WS2/gas −
    EAu-WS2 − Egas, where EAu-WS2/gas, EAu-WS2, and Egas are the total energies of
    the gas adsorbed system, Au-WS2 system, and isolated gas molecule, respectively'
  - Compare the Ead values for different orientations. The most negative value corresponds
    to the most stable adsorption configuration (MSC)
  - 'Expected results: Ead for CO = -0.82 eV, Ead for HCHO = -1.01 eV'
- claim: The sensing responses of the Au-WS2 monolayer upon CO and HCHO molecule introduction
    were 58.7% and −74.4%, with recovery times of 0.01 s and 11.86 s, respectively.
  instruction:
  - Use the optimized structures of Au-WS2, Au-WS2/CO, and Au-WS2/HCHO from previous
    calculations
  - Calculate the band gaps (Bg) for each system
  - 'Calculate the electrical conductivity (σ) using the formula: σ = λ * exp(-Bg/2kT),
    where λ is a constant, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature (298
    K)'
  - 'Calculate the sensing response (S) using the formula: S = (σ_gas^-1 - σ_pure^-1)
    / σ_pure^-1'
  - 'Calculate the recovery time (τ) using the formula: τ = A^-1 * exp(-Ead/kT), where
    A is the attempt frequency (1x10^16 Hz), Ead is the adsorption energy, k is the
    Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature (298 K)'
  - 'Expected results: S_CO = 58.7%, S_HCHO = -74.4%, τ_CO = 0.01 s, τ_HCHO = 11.86
    s'
