claims:
- claim: SiBi monolayer is a semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 0.4 eV (PBE+SOC)
    and 0.65 eV (HSE06+SOC).
  instruction:
  - 'Construct a SiBi monolayer with a GaSe-like structure (P3m1 space group). Lattice
    parameter: 4.09 Å. Bond lengths: d1 = 2.69 Å, d2 = 2.31 Å. Bond angles: q1 = 98.94°,
    q2 = 118.63°. Thickness: 4.89 Å'
  - 'DFT setup in OpenMX: - Exchange-correlation: PBE-GGA functional - Pseudopotentials:
    Norm-conserving - Basis set: s2p2d1 for Si, cutoff radius 7.0 - Energy cutoff:
    400 Ry - k-points: 23x23x1 Monkhorst-Pack grid - Van der Waals correction: DFT-D2
    - Spin-orbit coupling: Include SOC'
  - Relax atomic positions until forces < 1 meV/Å
  - Calculate band structure along high-symmetry path
  - 'Expected result (PBE+SOC): Indirect band gap of 0.4 eV'
  - Repeat steps 2-4 using HSE06 functional
  - 'Expected result (HSE06+SOC): Indirect band gap of 0.65 eV'
- claim: SiBi bilayer exhibits a direct band gap of 0.25 eV (PBE+SOC).
  instruction:
  - Construct a SiBi bilayer by stacking two optimized monolayers with an interlayer
    distance of approximately 4.20 Å
  - Follow steps 2-4 from the previous claim
  - 'Expected result: Direct band gap of 0.25 eV'
- claim: The band gap of SiBi monolayer decreases under compressive strain and increases
    under tensile strain.
  instruction:
  - Apply uniaxial or biaxial strain to the optimized SiBi monolayer
  - Vary strain from -6% (compressive) to +6% (tensile) in steps of 1%
  - For each strain value, relax the atomic positions and calculate the band structure
    as described in the first claim
  - Observe the trend of band gap change with strain
- claim: SiBi bilayer undergoes a semiconductor-to-metal transition under an electric
    field of 0.4 V/Å.
  instruction:
  - Apply an electric field perpendicular to the SiBi bilayer
  - Vary the electric field strength from 0 to 0.8 V/Å
  - For each field strength, calculate the band structure as described in the first
    claim
  - Observe the band gap closure at approximately 0.4 V/Å
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: SiBi nanosheet is a promising candidate for designing high-speed low-dissipation
    devices.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Requires device fabrication and characterization,
    which is beyond the scope of DFT calculations.'
- claim: Simulated STM image of the SiBi monolayer.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: While STM images can be simulated
    based on DFT calculations, the provided information is insufficient to reproduce
    the exact image shown in the paper.'
