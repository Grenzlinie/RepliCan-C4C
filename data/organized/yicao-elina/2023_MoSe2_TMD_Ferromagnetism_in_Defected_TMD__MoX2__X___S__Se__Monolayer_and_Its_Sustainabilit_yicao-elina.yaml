claims:
- claim: Pristine MoS2 monolayer exhibits a direct band gap of 1.626 eV at the K-point.
  instruction:
  - Create a unit cell of MoS2 monolayer
  - 'DFT setup in SIESTA: - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional - Basis set: DZP
    - Energy cutoff: 300 Ry - K-points: 10x10x1 Monkhorst-Pack grid - Convergence
    criteria: Energy 1e-6 eV, Force 1 meV/Å'
  - Relax atomic positions
  - Calculate band structure along high-symmetry path including the K-point
  - 'Expected result: Direct band gap of 1.626 eV at the K-point'
- claim: Pristine MoSe2 monolayer exhibits a direct band gap of 1.460 eV at the K-point.
  instruction:
  - Create a unit cell of MoSe2 monolayer
  - DFT setup in SIESTA (same as above for MoS2)
  - Relax atomic positions
  - Calculate band structure along high-symmetry path including the K-point
  - 'Expected result: Direct band gap of 1.460 eV at the K-point'
- claim: A Mo vacancy (VMo) in MoSe2 introduces a magnetic moment of 3.99 µB.
  instruction:
  - Create supercells (4x4 to 8x8) of MoSe2 monolayer
  - Remove one Mo atom to create VMo
  - 'DFT setup in VASP: - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional - Pseudopotentials:
    PAW (Mo: 4s, 4p, 4d, 5s; Se: 3s, 3p) - Energy cutoff: 400 eV - K-points: 5x5x1
    Monkhorst-Pack grid - Spin-polarized calculation with SOC - Hubbard U: 4.5 eV
    for Mo - Convergence criteria: Energy 1e-5 eV, Force 0.01 eV/Å'
  - Relax atomic positions
  - Calculate magnetic moment
  - 'Expected result: 3.99 µB'
- claim: MoSe2 with VMo exhibits half-metallicity for 4x4 and 5x5 supercells.
  instruction:
  - Use the relaxed structures from the previous VMo calculation with 4x4 and 5x5
    supercells
  - Perform spin-polarized DFT calculations with VASP (same settings as above)
  - Calculate band structure
  - Analyze spin-up and spin-down channels
  - 'Expected result: Spin-up channel metallic, spin-down channel semiconducting'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: Raman spectroscopy confirms N incorporation
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: Requires experimental Raman measurements.'
- claim: Device mobility increases by 20%
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Requires device fabrication and electrical
    measurements.'
- claim: STM images show the presence of S and Mo vacancies.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: Requires experimental STM measurements.'
- claim: MoS2 is more thermodynamically stable than MoSe2.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: While binding energies are calculated,
    direct comparison to experimental thermodynamic stability requires additional
    data not provided.'
