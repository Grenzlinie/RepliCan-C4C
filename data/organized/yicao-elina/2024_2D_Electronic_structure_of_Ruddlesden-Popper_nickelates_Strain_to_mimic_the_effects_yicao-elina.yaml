claims:
- claim: Compressive strain of -3% on La3Ni2O7 brings the Ni-O-Ni bond angle to ~172°.
  instruction:
  - Start with the Amam structure of La3Ni2O7
  - Apply -3% biaxial strain (ϵ = a∗(b∗)/a(b))
  - Relax the out-of-plane lattice constant (c) and internal coordinates using VASP
  - 'DFT setup in VASP: - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional - Energy cutoff: 500
    eV - K-points: 8×8×2 mesh - Force convergence: 1 meV/Å'
  - Measure the Ni-O-Ni bond angle (θ) after relaxation
  - 'Expected result: ~172°'
- claim: Tensile strain of +3% on La3Ni2O7 results in an out-of-plane Ni-O-Ni bond
    angle of ~161°.

  - Measure the Ni-O-Ni bond angle (θ) after relaxation
  - 'Expected result: ~161°'
- claim: Under -3% compressive strain, the dz2 bonding band in La3Ni2O7 around M is
    fully occupied and the γ pocket is absent from the Fermi surface.
  instruction:
  - Use the relaxed structure of La3Ni2O7 with -3% strain (Amam or Fmmm)
  - Perform electronic structure calculation using WIEN2k
  - 'DFT setup in WIEN2k: - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional - RMT Kmax: 7.0 -
    Muffin-tin radii: La=2.39, Ni=1.85, O=1.64 a.u. - K-points: 11×11×11 mesh'
  - Calculate band structure and Fermi surface
  - Analyze the occupation of the dz2 band around M and presence/absence of the γ
    pocket
  - 'Expected result: dz2 band fully occupied, γ pocket absent'
- claim: Under +3% tensile strain, the dz2 bonding band in La3Ni2O7 crosses the Fermi
    level, giving rise to the γ pocket.

  - Analyze the position of the dz2 band relative to the Fermi level and presence/absence
    of the γ pocket
  - 'Expected result: dz2 band crosses Fermi level, γ pocket present'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: Strain could perhaps also enable decoupling of different pairing symmetries.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Requires further investigation and
    calculations of superconducting pairing, which are complex and computationally
    demanding.'
- claim: Strain could likely serve as a means to tune the pairing symmetry if superconductivity
    can be achieved.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Requires further investigation and
    calculations of superconducting pairing.'
- claim: The suppression of octahedral tilts is likely not a sufficient condition
    for superconducting signatures to arise in RP nickelates.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: Relates to the interpretation of
    experimental results and the connection to superconductivity, which is beyond
    the scope of DFT calculations alone.'
