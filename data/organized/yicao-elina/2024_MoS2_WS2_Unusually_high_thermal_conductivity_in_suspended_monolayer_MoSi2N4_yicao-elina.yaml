claims:
- claim: Monolayer MoSi2N4 has a Debye temperature of 436.45 K.
  instruction:
  - Optimize the crystal structure of monolayer MoSi2N4 using VASP
  - 'DFT setup in VASP: - Exchange-correlation: GGA-PBE functional - PAW method -
    Plane-wave cutoff energy: 500 eV - K-mesh: 15×15×1 - Vacuum space: 20 Å - Convergence
    criteria for energy: 10⁻⁸ eV - Convergence criteria for forces: 10⁻⁸ eV/Å'
  - Calculate phonon dispersions and second-order interatomic force constants (IFCs)
    using Phonopy
  - Calculate Debye temperature using the calculated phonon dispersions
  - 'Expected result: 436.45 K'
- claim: Monolayer MoSi2N4 has a Grüneisen parameter of 0.77 at 300 K.
  instruction:
  - Use the optimized crystal structure and phonon dispersions from the previous calculation
  - Calculate third-order anharmonic IFCs using thirdorder package with a cutoff distance
    of 8 atoms
  - Calculate Grüneisen parameter using the calculated second- and third-order IFCs
  - 'Expected result: 0.77 at 300 K'
- claim: Monolayer MoSi2N4 has a thermal conductivity of 492.7 W·m⁻¹·K⁻¹ at 300 K.
  instruction:
  - Use the calculated second- and third-order IFCs from the previous calculations
  - Solve the phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) using ShengBTE
  - 'Calculation setup in ShengBTE: - q-grid: 111×111×1 - Cutoff distance: 8 atoms
    - Include Born effective charges and dielectric constants'
  - 'Expected result: 492.7 W·m⁻¹·K⁻¹ at 300 K'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: Experimentally measured thermal conductivity of ~173 W·m⁻¹·K⁻¹ at room temperature
    for suspended monolayer MoSi2N4 using a noncontact optothermal Raman technique.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: Requires experimental Raman measurements
    and specialized equipment.'
- claim: The measured thermal conductivity is much higher than those of the 2D semiconductors
    reported so far including MoS₂, WS₂, MoSe₂, WSe₂, Bi₂O₂Se and black phosphorus,
    typically less than 100 W·m⁻¹·K⁻¹.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: Requires experimental measurements
    for comparison.'
- claim: N_2 vacancy plays a major role in the high-frequency phonon scattering, while
    the N_1 vacancy has relatively little influence.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: Details of defect calculations and
    scattering analysis are not provided.'
