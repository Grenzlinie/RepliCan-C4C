claims:
- claim: PBE yields a lower MARD than PBE+U (4.0% versus 6.05%) for in-plane lattice
    constants compared to experimental bulk values.
  instruction:
  - Obtain structures of 98 2D materials from the C2DB database that have corresponding
    experimental bulk data
  - 'Relax the monolayer structures using: - GPAW code - PBE functional - Plane-wave
    cutoff: 800 eV - K-point density: 12 Å⁻¹ - Force convergence: 0.01 eV/Å'
  - 'Relax the same monolayer structures using: - GPAW code - PBE+U functional (Ueff
    = 4 eV for 3d orbitals of V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) - Same other parameters as
    PBE calculation'
  - Compare the calculated in-plane lattice constants (largest for anisotropic materials)
    with experimental bulk values
  - Calculate the Mean Absolute Relative Deviation (MARD) for both PBE and PBE+U results
  - 'Expected result: PBE MARD ≈ 4.0%, PBE+U MARD ≈ 6.05%'
- claim: The band gap of CrI3 increases from 0.89 eV (U=0 eV) to 1.2 eV (U=4.0 eV).
  instruction:
  - Obtain the relaxed CrI3 monolayer structure from the C2DB database or relax it
    using PBE as described above
  - 'Perform a band structure calculation using: - GPAW code - PBE functional - Plane-wave
    cutoff: 800 eV - K-point density: 12 Å⁻¹'
  - 'Perform another band structure calculation using: - GPAW code - PBE+U functional
    (Ueff = 4 eV for Cr 3d orbitals) - Same other parameters as PBE calculation'
  - Extract the band gap from both calculations
  - 'Expected result: PBE band gap ≈ 0.89 eV, PBE+U band gap ≈ 1.2 eV'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: Experimental band gap of CrI3 is reported as 1.2 eV.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: Requires experimental measurements.'
- claim: All the calculated properties are available in the Computational 2D Materials
    Database (C2DB).
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: While the paper mentions C2DB, no
    specific link or access instructions are provided for this particular dataset.'
