claims:
- claim: A phase transition from antiferromagnetism (AFM) to ferromagnetism (FM) occurs
    in monolayer CrCl3 at 2.5% compressive strain.
  instruction:
  - Construct a monolayer CrCl3 structure
  - Apply a range of compressive strains around 2.5% to the lattice
  - Perform DFT calculations for both AFM and FM configurations at each strain value
  - Compare the total energies of the AFM and FM configurations
  - Observe the strain value at which the FM configuration becomes energetically favorable
  - 'Expected result: FM becomes more stable than AFM at approximately -2.5% strain.  The
    paper references [59] for this claim.  Further details on the DFT setup would
    need to be extracted from that source'
- claim: Applying a 2.1% tensile strain to monolayer CrBr3 increases the Curie temperature
    (Tc) to 44 K.
  instruction:
  - Construct a monolayer CrBr3 structure
  - Apply a 2.1% tensile strain to the lattice
  - Perform DFT calculations to obtain the exchange coupling parameters
  - Use the exchange coupling parameters to calculate Tc (e.g., using mean-field theory
    or Monte Carlo simulations)
  - 'Expected result: Tc â‰ˆ 44 K. The paper references [59] for this claim. Further
    details on the DFT setup and Tc calculation method would need to be extracted
    from that source'
- claim: Applying a compressive strain greater than 7% to monolayer CrI3 leads to
    a phase transition from FM to AFM.
  instruction:
  - Construct a monolayer CrI3 structure
  - Apply a range of compressive strains greater than 7% to the lattice
  - Perform DFT calculations for both AFM and FM configurations at each strain value
  - Compare the total energies of the AFM and FM configurations
  - Observe the strain value at which the AFM configuration becomes energetically
    favorable
  - 'Expected result: AFM becomes more stable than FM at approximately -7% strain.
    The paper references [71] for this claim. Further details on the DFT setup would
    need to be extracted from that source'
- claim: Applying biaxial tensile strain to monolayer CrTe2 in the T phase does not
    cause a phase transition from direct to indirect bandgap.
  instruction:
  - Construct a monolayer CrTe2 structure in the T phase
  - Apply a range of biaxial tensile strains to the lattice
  - Perform DFT calculations to determine the band structure at each strain value
  - Analyze the band structure to determine whether the band gap is direct or indirect
  - 'Expected result: The band gap remains direct for all applied tensile strains.
    The paper references [104] for this claim. Further details on the DFT setup would
    need to be extracted from that source'
- claim: Applying biaxial strain to monolayer CrTe2 leads to a phase transformation
    at -1% compressive strain.
  instruction:
  - Construct a monolayer CrTe2 structure
  - Apply a range of biaxial strains around -1% to the lattice
  - Perform DFT calculations to determine the ground state magnetic configuration
    at each strain value
  - Observe the strain value at which a phase transformation occurs
  - 'Expected result: A phase transformation (e.g., from FM to AFM) occurs at approximately
    -1% strain. The paper references [105] for this claim. Further details on the
    DFT setup would need to be extracted from that source'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: Wrinkled areas of Cr2Ge2Te6 have a higher Tc than flat areas.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Reproducing the exact wrinkle morphology
    and strain distribution experimentally is challenging, making precise computational
    modeling difficult.'
- claim: Applying a gate voltage to a suspended Cr2Ge2Te6/WSe2 heterostructure increases
    Tc.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Modeling the complex electrostatic
    interactions and strain distribution in the heterostructure requires specialized
    techniques beyond standard DFT calculations.'
- claim: Field-cooling induces strain in Cr2Ge2Te6 flakes.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Simulating the field-cooling process
    and its effect on the strain and magnetic domain structure requires advanced multiphysics
    simulations.'
- claim: High-quality, single-crystalline Fe4GeTe2 thin films grown on sapphire substrate
    by MBE exhibit a Tc close to room temperature.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Accurately modeling the MBE growth
    process and the resulting strain distribution in the thin film is computationally
    demanding.'
