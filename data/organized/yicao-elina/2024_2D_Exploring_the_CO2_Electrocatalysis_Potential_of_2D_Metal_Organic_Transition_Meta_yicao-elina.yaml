claims:
- claim: Nitrogen substitution at sulfur site has formation energy of 2.34 eV in monolayer
    MoS2
  instruction:
  - This paper focuses on CO2 reduction, not defect formation energies.  The supplementary
    information contains Gibbs free energies for various reaction steps, but not formation
    energies in the same sense as defect calculations.  Therefore, direct reproduction
    of a formation energy claim is not possible
- claim: Ti and Cr primarily produced HCOOH, with corresponding 0.606 V and 0.236
    V overpotentials.
  instruction:
  - Construct the TM-HHTQ structure (TM = Ti, Cr) as described in the paper (Figure
    1).  The exact structure is not provided, but the paper mentions 42 C, 12 O, 8
    N, and 3 TM atoms per unit cell
  - 'DFT setup in DMol3: - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional - Basis set: DNP -
    Core treatment: DSPP - Van der Waals correction: Grimme D2 - Solvation: COSMO
    (water, ε = 78.54) - K-points: 3x3x1 for geometry optimization, 6x6x1 for electronic
    structure - Energy convergence: 10^-6 eV'
  - Calculate the Gibbs free energy profile for the CO2 reduction pathway as described
    in Section 2.5.2 and Figure 7.  The supplementary information (Tables S5 and S6)
    provides the Gibbs free energy changes for each step
  - Identify the rate-determining step and extract the limiting potential (UL)
  - Calculate the overpotential (η) using Equation 5 and the equilibrium potential
    for HCOOH formation. The paper does not explicitly state the equilibrium potential
    used
  - 'Expected results: Ti (η = 0.606 V), Cr (η = 0.236 V)'
- claim: Vanadium produced CH4 as the main product with an overpotential of 0.675
    V
  instruction:
  - Similar to the HCOOH claim, follow steps 1-5, but using V-HHTQ and the CH4 pathway
    described in Section 2.5.3 and Figure 8.  Use Table S7 for Gibbs free energy changes
  - 'Expected result: V (η = 0.675 V)'
- claim: Fe formed HCHO with an overpotential of 0.342 V
  instruction:
  - Similar to the previous claims, use Fe-HHTQ and the HCHO pathway (Section 2.5.5,
    Figure 10, Table S9)
  - 'Expected result: Fe (η = 0.342 V)'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: Raman spectroscopy confirms N incorporation
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: Requires experimental Raman measurements.'
- claim: Device mobility increases by 20%
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Requires device fabrication and electrical
    measurements.'
