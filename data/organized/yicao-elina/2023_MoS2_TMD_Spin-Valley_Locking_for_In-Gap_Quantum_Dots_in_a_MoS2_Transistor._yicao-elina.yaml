claims:
- claim: '7L MoS2: CB minima at Q-points, K-points mixing 137 meV above (DFT calculations)'
  instruction:
  - Construct a 7-layer MoS2 structure
  - Perform DFT calculations (the paper does not specify the code or parameters used)
  - Calculate the band structure
  - Determine the location of the conduction band minima (CBM) and the energy difference
    between the CBM at Q and K points
  - 'Expected result: CBM at Q-points, K-points mixing 137 meV above'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: g⊥ = 2.2 ± 0.2 (D1) and g⊥ = 8.1 ± 0.2 (D2)
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: These g-factors are extracted from
    experimental measurements of Zeeman-shifted spin-valley ground states in an out-of-plane
    magnetic field.  The raw data and precise experimental setup are not available
    to reproduce these values computationally.'
- claim: g∥ = 0.8 ± 0.1 for both transitions D1 and D2
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: Similar to the out-of-plane g-factors,
    the in-plane g-factor is derived from experimental measurements of the Zeeman
    shift in an in-plane magnetic field.  The raw data is needed for reproduction.'
- claim: 2∆ = 138 ± 6 µeV (D2) and 2∆ = 93 ± 6 µeV (D1)
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: These values are extracted from experimental
    fits to the in-plane Zeeman shift data, which is not available.'
- claim: Spin-orbit splitting in the conduction band of order 2∆SO ≈ 100 µeV
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: This value is estimated based on
    the experimental measurements and analysis, not directly from DFT calculations.'
- claim: Pronounced Zeeman anisotropy with near-vanishing Zeeman shifts for in-plane
    magnetic fields
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: This is an experimental observation
    based on measuring Zeeman shifts at different magnetic field angles.  Reproducing
    this requires the experimental data.'
- claim: Multiple resonances with splitting of order meV, parallel to the diamond
    edges
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: This observation from bias spectroscopy
    requires the experimental data to reproduce.'
- claim: Dot radius at most between 1.88 nm to 4.1 nm
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: This estimation is based on experimental
    observations and assumptions about the orbital splitting and dimensionality of
    the dot, not directly from DFT.'
- claim: Tel = (150 ± 40) mK
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: This is the experimentally determined
    electron temperature.'
