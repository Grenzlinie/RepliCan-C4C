claims:
  - claim: "The exfoliation energy of O-terminated Al2O3 on bilayer graphene is 32.67 meV A−2, much larger than that of 12.44 meV A−2 for Al-terminated Al2O3."
    instruction:
      - "1. Prepare structures:
   - Bulk α-Al2O3 (0001) slab (thickness > 12 Å) with Al- and O- terminations.
   - Bilayer graphene (2x2x1 supercell)"
      - "Interface setup:
   - Place the Al2O3 slab on the bilayer graphene.
   - Consider both Al- and O-terminated Al2O3.
   - Add a 15 Å vacuum layer"
      - "DFT Calculation (VASP):
   - Functional: PBE
   - vdW correction: Grimme D3
   - K-points: 6x6x1 (Gamma-centered)
   - Energy cutoff: 450 eV
   - Spin-polarized calculation
   - Dipole correction
   - Convergence criteria: Electronic 10^-5 eV, Ionic 0.01 eV/Å"
      - "Exfoliation energy calculation:
   - Calculate the energy of the equilibrium interface structure (E_interface).
