claims:
- claim: The relaxed cell parameters for the pristine CsPbBr3 supercell (3 × 3 × 2)
    (with Pnma spacegroup) were found to be 8.267, 8.177 and 11.768 Å.
  instruction:
  - Create a 3 × 3 × 2 supercell of CsPbBr3 with Pnma spacegroup
  - 'DFT setup in Quantum Espresso: - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional - Pseudopotentials:
    Ultrasoft pseudopotentials - K-points: Not explicitly mentioned, likely Gamma
    point for supercell relaxation. - Kinetic energy cutoff: 40 Ry - Charge density
    cutoff: 400 Ry'
  - Relax atomic positions and cell volume until forces and stresses converge
  - 'Expected result: a = 8.267 Å, b = 8.177 Å, c = 11.768 Å'
- claim: Formation energy of neutral Br interstitial (Bri) ranges from 0.59-0.71 eV
    (2 × 2 × 2 supercell) and 0.59-0.63 eV (3 × 2 × 2 supercell).
  instruction:
  - Create a 2 × 2 × 2 or 3 × 2 × 2 supercell of CsPbBr3
  - Introduce a neutral Br interstitial at various off-lattice positions
  - DFT setup in Quantum Espresso (same as above)
  - Relax atomic positions
  - Calculate formation energy using equation (3) in the paper
  - 'Expected result: 0.59-0.71 eV (2 × 2 × 2) or 0.59-0.63 eV (3 × 2 × 2)'
- claim: Migration energy (Em) for neutral Bri ranges from 0.20 to 0.54 eV.
  instruction:
  - Create a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell of CsPbBr3 with a neutral Bri
  - Identify initial and final interstitial positions
  - Perform NEB calculation using Quantum Espresso with 10 intermediate images
  - Extract the highest energy difference along the NEB path
  - 'Expected result: 0.20-0.54 eV depending on the specific pathway'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: XRD pattern generated from the simulated pristine supercell matches experimental
    results.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: Experimental XRD data not provided
    in the paper or ESI.'
- claim: The recovery rate of the conductivity observed by Tirmzi and co-workers was
    not noticeably different near grain boundaries.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: This is an experimental observation.'
- claim: Device performance improvement by defect passivation.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Requires device fabrication and testing,
    beyond the scope of DFT calculations.'
