claims:
  - claim: "The relaxed cell parameters for the pristine CsPbBr3 supercell (3 x 3 x 2)

      - "Expected output: approximately 8.267, 8.177, and 11.768 Å."

  - claim: "Defect formation energies for Bri ranging from 0.60–0.71 eV and 0.59–0.63
    eV for neutral Bri 2 x 2 x 2 and 3 x 2 x 2 systems, respectively, and between
    0.74–1.00 eV and 0.66–0.88 eV for Br0i 2 x 2 x 2 and 3 x 2 x 2 systems, respectively."
    instruction:
      - "Create 2 x 2 x 2 and 3 x 2 x 2 supercells of CsPbBr3 using Quantum     ESPRESSO."

      - "Perform relax calculations to find the preferred structure."
      - "Calculate defect formation energy using equation (3) mentioned in the paper  and the Freysoldt correction scheme."
      - "Expected output: DFE within the mentioned ranges for each respective supercell     size and charge state."

  - claim: "Activation energy of 0.335 eV for the recombination of a pair of anti-sites
    Br_Pb–Pb_Br."
    instruction:
      - "Create a 2 x 2 x 2 supercell of CsPbBr3 using Quantum ESPRESSO."
      - "Introduce BrPb and PbBr anti-site defects within a first nearest neighbor distance."
      - "Perform relax calculations to find the preferred initial and final structures for recombination."
      - "Perform NEB calculations using Quantum ESPRESSO to find the minimum energy pathway for recombination and extract the activation energy."
      - "Expected output: Activation energy of approximately 0.335 eV"


non_reproducible_claims:
  - claim: "The DFT-simulated peaks line up, essentially perfectly, with the experimental results"
    reason: "reason: data_unavailable
explanation: Experimental XRD data for comparison can not be directly read in the paper."
