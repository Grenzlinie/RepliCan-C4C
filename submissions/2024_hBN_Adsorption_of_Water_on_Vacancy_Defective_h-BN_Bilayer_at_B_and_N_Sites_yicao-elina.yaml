claims:
- claim: Pristine h-BN bilayer has a band gap of 4.56 eV.
  instruction:
  - Create a 4x4x1 supercell of h-BN bilayer (64 atoms)
  - 'DFT setup in Quantum Espresso: - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional with DFT-D2
    (Grimme) van der Waals correction - Pseudopotentials: RRKJ ultrasoft pseudopotentials
    - K-points: 22x22x1 - Kinetic energy cutoff: 35 Ry'
  - Relax atomic positions until forces < 10^-3 Ry/Bohr and energy change < 10^-4
    Ry
  - Perform band structure calculation along Γ-M-K-Γ with 200 k-points
  - Extract band gap from band structure
  - 'Expected result: 4.56 eV'
- claim: B-hBN (single Boron vacancy) has a band gap of 1.25 eV.
  instruction:
  - Create a 4x4x1 supercell of h-BN bilayer (64 atoms)
  - Remove one B atom from the top layer to create the B vacancy
  - DFT setup in Quantum Espresso (same as pristine h-BN)
  - Relax atomic positions
  - Perform band structure calculation
  - Extract band gap
  - 'Expected result: 1.25 eV'
- claim: N-hBN (single Nitrogen vacancy) has a band gap of 1.49 eV.
  instruction:
  - Create a 4x4x1 supercell of h-BN bilayer (64 atoms)
  - Remove one N atom from the top layer to create the N vacancy
  - DFT setup in Quantum Espresso (same as pristine h-BN)
  - Relax atomic positions
  - Perform band structure calculation
  - Extract band gap
  - 'Expected result: 1.49 eV'
- claim: B-hBN has a magnetic moment of -1.71 µB/cell.
  instruction:
  - Use the relaxed structure of B-hBN from the band gap calculation
  - Perform spin-polarized DFT calculation (same setup as before)
  - Extract magnetic moment from output
  - 'Expected result: -1.71 µB/cell'
- claim: N-hBN has a magnetic moment of 1.00 µB/cell.
  instruction:
  - Use the relaxed structure of N-hBN from the band gap calculation
  - Perform spin-polarized DFT calculation (same setup as before)
  - Extract magnetic moment from output
  - 'Expected result: 1.00 µB/cell'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: Water adsorption on B-hBN (w-B-hBN) has a band gap of 0.97 eV.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: The exact position and orientation
    of the adsorbed water molecule are not specified, making it difficult to reproduce
    the exact structure and therefore the band gap.'
- claim: Water adsorption on N-hBN (w-N-hBN) has a band gap of 1.24 eV.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: Similar to w-B-hBN, the precise adsorption
    configuration of the water molecule is not provided.'
- claim: w-B-hBN has a magnetic moment of -1.00 µB/cell.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: Dependent on the non-reproducible
    w-B-hBN structure.'
- claim: w-N-hBN has a magnetic moment of 1.00 µB/cell.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: Dependent on the non-reproducible
    w-N-hBN structure.'
