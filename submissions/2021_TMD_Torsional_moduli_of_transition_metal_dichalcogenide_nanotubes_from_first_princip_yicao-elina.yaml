claims:
- claim: Torsional moduli follow the trend MS2 > MSe2 > MTe2.
  instruction:
  - Construct armchair and zigzag TMD nanotubes with M = {V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Fe,
    Cu} and X = {S, Se, Te} for 2H-t symmetry and M={Ti, Zr, Hf, Mn, Ni, Pd, Pt} and
    X={S, Se, Te} for 1T-o symmetry
  - Use radii commensurate with experimentally synthesized nanotubes or similar structures
  - 'Perform symmetry-adapted DFT calculations using Cyclix-DFT (based on SPARC) with
    the following parameters: - Pseudopotentials: Optimized norm-conserving Vanderbilt
    (ONCV) from the SG15 collection. - Exchange-correlation functional: Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof
    (PBE). - Numerical parameters: Grid spacing, Brillouin zone integration points,
    vacuum, and structural relaxation tolerances converged to 1% accuracy in torsional
    moduli (energy converged to 10^-5 Ha/atom)'
  - Calculate ground state energies for various twisted configurations (θ) of each
    nanotube
  - Fit the energy vs. twist data to E(d, θ) = E(d, 0) + 1/2 * K(d) * θ^2 to extract
    torsional modulus K(d)
  - 'Compare K(d) values across different M and X combinations.  Expected trend: MS2
    > MSe2 > MTe2'
- claim: Torsional moduli display a power law dependence on diameter, close to cubic.
  instruction:
  - Follow steps 1-5 from the previous claim
  - Fit the torsional modulus K(d) vs. diameter (d) data to K(d) = k*d^α + K(0) to
    extract the exponent α
  - 'Expected result: α is generally close to 3'
- claim: Shear moduli determined from torsional moduli agree with those predicted
    from Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio.
  instruction:
  - Follow steps 1-5 from the first claim
  - Calculate shear modulus G from the torsional modulus coefficient k using G = k
    / 2π
  - Independently calculate Young's modulus (E) and Poisson's ratio (ν) using Cyclix-DFT
  - Calculate shear modulus using the isotropic relation G = E / 2(1+ν)
  - 'Compare the shear moduli obtained from steps 2 and 4. Expected result: Good agreement
    between the two values, indicating elastic isotropy'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: The largest torsional modulus value obtained is nearly three times smaller
    than that of carbon nanotubes.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: The paper mentions the carbon nanotube
    value but doesn''t provide details on how it was calculated, making direct comparison
    difficult.'
- claim: Linear regression model based on bond characteristics can predict torsional
    moduli.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: The specific parameters of the linear
    regression model (coefficients, etc.) are not provided in the paper, hindering
    reproduction of the model''s predictions.'
