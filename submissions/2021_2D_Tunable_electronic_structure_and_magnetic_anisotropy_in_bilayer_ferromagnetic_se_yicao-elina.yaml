claims:
- claim: The pristine bilayer Cr2Ge2Te6 has a lattice constant a=b=6.838 Å, interlayer
    distance of 3.437 Å, band gap of 0.374 eV, and MAE of 0.162 meV/u.c.
  instruction:
  - Construct a bilayer Cr2Ge2Te6 structure in AB stacking (see Figure 1 in the paper)
  - 'DFT setup in VASP: - Exchange-correlation: PBEsol functional + GGA+U (Ueff =
    1.7 eV for Cr d orbitals) - Pseudopotentials: PAW (Cr: 2p63d54s1, Ge: 4s24p2,
    Te: 5s25p4) - K-points: 7x7x1 for structural optimization, 20x20x1 for electronic
    structure - Kinetic energy cutoff: 500 eV - Convergence criteria: Energy difference
    < 1e-6 eV, Forces < 0.01 eV/Å'
  - Relax the structure
  - Calculate the band structure and MAE (include spin-orbit coupling for MAE)
  - 'Expected results: a=b=6.838(2) Å, interlayer distance = 3.437 Å, band gap = 0.374
    eV, MAE = 0.162 meV/u.c'
- claim: Applying -2% compressive strain reduces the band gap to 0.174 eV and increases
    MAE to 0.300 meV/u.c.
  instruction:
  - Use the relaxed pristine structure from the previous calculation
  - Apply -2% biaxial strain (a = 0.98 * 6.838 Å)
  - Relax the atomic positions while keeping the lattice constant fixed
  - Calculate the band structure and MAE (include spin-orbit coupling for MAE)
  - 'Expected results: band gap = 0.174 eV, MAE = 0.300 meV/u.c'
- claim: Applying 1% tensile strain increases the band gap to 0.446 eV and reduces
    MAE to 0.222 meV/u.c.
  instruction:
  - Use the relaxed pristine structure
  - Apply 1% biaxial strain (a = 1.01 * 6.838 Å)
  - Relax the atomic positions while keeping the lattice constant fixed
  - Calculate the band structure and MAE
  - 'Expected results: band gap = 0.446 eV, MAE = 0.222 meV/u.c'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: The ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic transition can be induced by applying
    tensile strain more than 1%.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Requires calculating the energy difference
    between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic configurations, which can be computationally
    demanding for strained structures.'
- claim: Two types of half-metal can be induced by controlling electrostatic doping
    in the bilayer Cr2Ge2Te6.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: While band structures with doping
    are calculated, the specific doping concentrations to achieve half-metallicity
    are not precisely defined, making it difficult to reproduce the exact half-metallic
    state.'
- claim: The compressive strain can reverse the spin polarization of electrons at
    the conduction band minimum.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: While the band structures show changes
    in spin polarization at CBM with strain, the precise strain value where the reversal
    occurs is not explicitly stated.'
