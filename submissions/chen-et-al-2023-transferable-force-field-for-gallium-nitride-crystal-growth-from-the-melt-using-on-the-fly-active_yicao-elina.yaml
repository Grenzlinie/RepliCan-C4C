  instruction:
  - Use the combined FLARE++ force field (Ga, N2, GaN) mapped to LAMMPS
  - Create a supercell of 4096 gallium atoms
  - Perform NPT simulations at 1 bar from 100 K to 1000 K in 50 K increments
  - Equilibrate for 1 ns at each temperature with a 1 fs timestep

- claim: Nitrogen diffusivity is 0.71 cm²/s at 300 K and atmospheric pressure.
  instruction:
  - Use the combined FLARE++ force field in LAMMPS
  - Equilibrate the system in NPT at 300 K and 1 bar for 5 ns
  - Switch to NVT with a Nose-Hoover thermostat for another 5 ns

  - Extract diffusivity from the linear region of MSD vs. time
  - 'Expected result: 0.71 cm²/s'
- claim: Lattice parameters of wurtzite GaN deviate by a maximum of 0.2% from experimental
    values using the combined FLARE++ model.
  instruction:
  - Use the combined FLARE++ force field in LAMMPS
  - Relax a wurtzite GaN structure
  - Extract lattice parameters a and c
  - Compare with experimental values (a=3.22 Å, c=5.24 Å)
  - 'Expected maximum deviation: 0.2%'
- claim: The elastic tensor of GaN has an RMSE of 28 GPa compared to experimental
    values using the combined FLARE++ model.
  instruction:
  - Use the combined FLARE++ force field in LAMMPS
  - Apply small deformations (0.0001%) to a wurtzite GaN supercell
  - Calculate stress tensor derivatives to obtain elastic constants
  - Compare with experimental values and calculate RMSE
  - 'Expected RMSE: 28 GPa'
- claim: Melting point of GaN is estimated to be 3067 K at 6 GPa.
  instruction:
  - Use the combined FLARE++ force field in LAMMPS
  - Create a 6912-atom simulation box with a solid-liquid interface
  - Relax at 2800 K and 6 GPa in NPT for 1 ns
  - Heat the liquid region to 3250 K over 4 ns, then equilibrate for 4 ns
  - Remove constraints and relax in NVE for 4 ns
  - Decrease temperature in 100 K steps and monitor density and Ga-N coordination
  - Identify melting point where solid and liquid regions have equal volume and zero
    interface velocity
  - 'Expected result: 3067 K'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: Raman spectroscopy confirms N incorporation.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: Requires experimental Raman measurements.'
- claim: The AM growth model used by Gagnon et al. underestimates the observed growth
    rate.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: Requires access to the specific growth
    model and experimental data used by Gagnon et al.'
