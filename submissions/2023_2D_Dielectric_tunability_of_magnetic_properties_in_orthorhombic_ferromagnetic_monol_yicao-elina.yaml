claims:
- claim: Monolayer CrSBr has lattice constants a = 3.54 Å and b = 4.74 Å (without
    Ueff).
  instruction:
  - 'DFT setup in VASP: - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional - Energy cutoff: 400
    eV - K-points: 6x4x1 - Ueff: 0 eV'
  - Relax atomic positions and cell until forces < 10^-8 eV
  - Extract lattice constants a and b
  - 'Expected result: a = 3.54 Å, b = 4.74 Å'
- claim: The nearest neighbor exchange interaction (J1) is virtually independent of
    Ueff.
  instruction:
  - Perform a series of DFT calculations with different Ueff values (e.g., 0, 1, 2,
    3 eV) applied to Cr d-orbitals
  - Use a 2x2 supercell of CrSBr
  - Construct five different collinear magnetic configurations (FM, AFM1-AFM4) as
    described in the paper's Methods section and Figure 8
  - Calculate the energies of these configurations for each Ueff value
  - Extract the exchange interaction parameters (J1-J4) by solving the system of equations
    (19-33) provided in the Methods section
  - Observe the trend of J1 with respect to Ueff
  - 'Expected result: J1 remains relatively constant as Ueff changes'
- claim: The Curie temperature (Tc) of freestanding monolayer CrSBr is around 140-160
    K.
  instruction:
  - Obtain the exchange interaction parameters (J1-J4) and single-ion anisotropy parameters
    (D, E) from DFT calculations as described in the previous claim's instructions
  - Include the dipolar interaction term in the spin Hamiltonian
  - Use the Green's function formalism with Tyablikov decoupling as described in the
    paper's Methods section to calculate the temperature-dependent magnetization
  - Determine Tc as the temperature at which the magnetization goes to zero
  - Perform calculations with and without structural relaxation and with and without
    dipolar interactions to obtain the range of Tc values
  - 'Expected result: Tc falls within the range of 140-160 K, depending on the inclusion
    of relaxation and dipolar interactions'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: Experimentally determined Curie temperature for ML-CrSBr is ~146 K.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: Requires experimental measurements.'
- claim: The predicted difference in Tc and the magnon dispersion could be measured
    by depositing ML-CrSBr samples on substrates with essentially different dielectric
    constants or by covering the ML spatially with different materials.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: Requires experimental fabrication
    and measurement.'
