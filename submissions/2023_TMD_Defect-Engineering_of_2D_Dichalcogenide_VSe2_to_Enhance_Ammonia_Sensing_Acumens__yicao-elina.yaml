claims:
- claim: The introduction of Se vacancy to pristine VSe2 was found to cause about
    an eight-fold increase (from −0.12 eV to −0.97 eV) in adsorption energy.
  instruction:
  - Create a 4x4x1 supercell of pristine VSe2 monolayer
  - Create a 4x4x1 supercell of Se-vacant VSe2 monolayer by removing one Se atom
  - Place an NH3 molecule 2 Å above the VSe2 and VSe2(Sev) monolayers (N atom above
    V atom)
  - 'DFT setup in VASP: - Exchange-correlation: GGA-PBE functional - Van der Waals
    correction: Grimme DFT-D3 - Plane-wave cutoff energy: 600 eV - K-points: 6x6x1
    Gamma-centered grid - Force convergence criteria: 0.01 eV/Å'
  - Relax atomic positions
  - 'Calculate adsorption energy using equation (1) in the paper: BE = E(complex)
    - E(monolayer) - E(NH3)'
  - 'Expected results: Pristine VSe2 = -0.12 eV, Se-vacant VSe2 = -0.97 eV'
- claim: VSe2(Sev) + NH3 system promises a convenient recovery time (~2 s) at 300
    K under UV radiation.
  instruction:
  - Use the adsorption energy calculated for the VSe2(Sev) + NH3 system (-0.97 eV)
  - 'Use the following parameters in equation (2) from the paper: - T = 300 K - k
    = Boltzmann constant - ν = 1 x 10^14 Hz (for UV radiation) - Eads = -0.97 eV'
  - 'Calculate recovery time (τ) using the equation: τ = ν−1exp(−Eads/kT)'
  - 'Expected result: ~2 s'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: The presented results will thus potentially be useful for experimentalists
    in designing and developing VSe2-based NH3 sensors.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: This claim refers to the potential
    impact of the computational findings on experimental work, which is beyond the
    scope of computational reproduction.'
- claim: Raman spectroscopy confirms N incorporation
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: Requires experimental Raman measurements.'
