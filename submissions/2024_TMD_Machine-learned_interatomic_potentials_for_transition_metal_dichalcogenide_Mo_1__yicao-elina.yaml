  Mo1−xWxS2−2ySe2y alloys
paper_pdf: MISSING
identifier: MISSING
claim_type: custom_code
code_url: ''
data_url: ''
claims:
- claim: The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the Maximum Absolute Error (MAX) calculated
    for the phonon frequencies along the Γ–M–K–Γ path lie below 1 cm−1 and 3 cm−1
    respectively for all the pure monolayers.
  instruction:
  - Relax monolayer structures of MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, and WSe2 using the trained MACE
    potential
  - Use a 6x6x1 supercell for phonon calculations
  - Use the finite displacement method with ASE's Vibrations driver
  - Set atomic displacement to 0.01 Å
  - Calculate phonon dispersion along Γ-M-K-Γ
  - Compare frequencies with DFT (OPTB88) results, excluding frequencies < 10 cm^-1
  - Expected MAE < 1 cm^-1 and MAX < 3 cm^-1
- claim: Nitrogen substitution at sulfur site has formation energy of 2.34 eV in monolayer
    MoS2
  instruction:
  - '# These instructions are a placeholder from the prompt example. REPLACE with
    instructions relevant to a claim in the paper'
  - Create 4×4×1 supercell of MoS2 monolayer (32 atoms total)
  - Replace one S atom with N atom
  - 'DFT setup in Quantum Espresso: - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional - Pseudopotentials:
    SSSP efficiency library - K-points: 4×4×1 Monkhorst-Pack grid - Kinetic energy
    cutoff: 80 Ry - Charge density cutoff: 320 Ry - Van der Waals correction: Grimme
    D3'
  - Relax atomic positions until forces < 0.01 eV/Å
  - 'Calculate formation energy: E_f = E_defect + μ_S - E_pristine - μ_N'
  - 'Expected result: 2.34 ± 0.05 eV'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: We are able to demonstrate agreement with state-of-the-art experimental data,
    and consequently we are able to explain several heretofore unexplained features
    of their Raman spectra, including the appearance of disorder-induced peaks whose
    specific atomic motion cannot be directly inferred from experimental studies.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: Experimental data is not provided,
    and digitization from plots is unreliable for quantitative comparison.'
- claim: The Raman spectra of the parent compounds of these alloy materials are dominated
    by two Raman-active modes, denoted by E0 and A0 1 in the monolayer
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: This is an observation based on
    experimental Raman spectra, not a computational claim.'
