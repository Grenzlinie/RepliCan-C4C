claims:
  - claim: "A pair of isolated topological edge states emerges in a partial energy gap at 0.32 eV above the Fermi level."
    instruction:
      - "1. Construct a Bi(111) bilayer on a 4-BL Sb(111) film. The Bi bilayer is strained to match the Sb lattice constant (a=4.307 Å).  The atomic structure is optimized by relaxing all atomic coordinates until forces are smaller than 0.01 eV/Å"
      - "Use VASP with the following settings:
   - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional
   - Plane-wave cutoff: 400 eV
   - K-point mesh: 11x11x1 for bulk calculations, 1x11x1 for ribbon calculations.
   - Vacuum layer: > 15 Å"
      - "Calculate the electronic band structure"
      - "To confirm the presence of edge states, perform a calculation on a Bi BL nanoribbon (8 zigzag atomic chains wide) on a 4 BL Sb substrate"
      - "Analyze the edge-weighted band structure to identify the topological edge states within the partial energy gap around 0.32 eV above the Fermi level"
      - "Expected result: A single pair of edge states within the partial gap, localized at the edges of the Bi nanoribbon"

  - claim: "The Bi-derived Rashba states strongly hybridize with the Sb bulk state in the outer part (farther away from Γ), while the inner part remains tightly localized within the Bi overlayer."
    instruction:
      - "1. Use the same relaxed structure of Bi(111) bilayer on 4-BL or 20-BL Sb(111) film as in the previous claim"
      - "Perform DFT calculations using VASP with the settings described above"
      - "Calculate the electronic band structure and project the states onto Bi 6p orbitals"
      - "Analyze the band structure and orbital projections to observe the hybridization of Bi-derived Rashba states with Sb bulk states in the outer region and the localization of Bi states in the inner region near Γ"

  - claim: "The band structure around the central crossing point of Bi1 band resembles a massless 2D electron gas (2DEG)."
    instruction:
      - "1. Use the same relaxed structure and DFT settings as described in the previous claims"
      - "Calculate the electronic band structure"
      - "Analyze the band structure around the central crossing point of the Bi1 band"
      - "Expected result: Linear dispersion resembling a massless 2DEG"

non_reproducible_claims:
  - claim: "ARPES measurements demonstrate the evolution of the electronic band structure."
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: Requires experimental ARPES measurements."

  - claim: "The required gate voltage is about 3 V for a dielectric thickness of 10 Å."
    reason: "reason: practical_limits
explanation: Requires device fabrication and electrical measurements."

  - claim: "RHEED was employed to monitor the surface condition during the growth process."
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: Requires experimental RHEED measurements."
