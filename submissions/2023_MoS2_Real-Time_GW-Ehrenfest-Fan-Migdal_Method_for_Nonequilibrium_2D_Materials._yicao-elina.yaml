claims:
- claim: Dephasing time (τdeph) depends on excitation density (n) as τdeph^-1 = τ0^-1
    + cn^(1/3) in photoexcited MoS2 monolayer.
  instruction:
  - Obtain spin-orbit dependent electronic bands (ϵki), phononic bands (ωkν), Coulomb
    interaction (Vqkk′), and electron-phonon couplings (gν) for MoS2 monolayer.  (See
    Note 1 in Supporting Information of the paper for details, not provided here)
  - Set up a real-time simulation with NEGF using the Generalized Kadanoﬀ-Baym Ansatz
    for electrons and phonons. Include el-el correlations at the GW level and el-ph
    correlations at the Ehrenfest plus Fan-Migdal (FM) level
  - Excite the MoS2 monolayer with a 15 fs linearly polarized laser pulse with central
    frequency ω0 = band gap + 0.2 eV. Vary the pump fluence to achieve different excitation
    densities (n) in the range of 10^10 to 10^12 cm^-2
  - Calculate the macroscopic polarization P(t) and its k-components Pk(t)
  - Calculate Pdeph(t) = Σk |Pk(t)|
  - Fit the logarithmic plot of Pdeph(t) with an exponential function exp(-t/τdeph)
    to extract the dephasing time τdeph for each excitation density
  - Plot τdeph as a function of n and fit it with the function τdeph[n] = τ0 / (1
    + τ0 * c * n^(1/3))
  - 'Expected result:  τ0 = 311 fs and c = 1.50 × 10^-7 fs^-1 cm^(2/3)'
- claim: Nuclear coherence of LO and TO phonons in MoS2 persists for several hundreds
    of femtoseconds after photoexcitation.
  instruction:
  - Follow steps 1-3 from the previous claim
  - Extract the time-dependent nuclear displacements uν(t) for the LO and TO phonon
    modes from the Ehrenfest self-energy
  - Plot uν(t) as a function of time
  - Observe the oscillations of uν(t) and verify that no significant damping occurs
    within the simulation time window (approximately 400 fs)
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: The energy gain in the build-up of carrier dressing by phonons is the main
    responsible for the increase of the lattice temperature during the first 50-60
    fs.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: While the paper discusses energy
    exchange and lattice temperature, specific quantitative data and precise instructions
    to calculate these quantities are not provided.'
- claim: Intra-valley scattering and the build-up of the Coulomb screening are the
    fastest processes taking place, influencing the dynamics already during illumination.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: The paper makes this qualitative
    claim, but doesn''t provide specific quantitative data or instructions to isolate
    and measure the timescales of these processes.'
- claim: Inter-valley scattering is pivotal for reaching a homogeneous thermal distribution
    across the entire Brillouin zone.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: This is a qualitative observation.  Quantitative
    data and instructions to measure the degree of homogeneity and the timescale of
    inter-valley scattering are not provided.'
