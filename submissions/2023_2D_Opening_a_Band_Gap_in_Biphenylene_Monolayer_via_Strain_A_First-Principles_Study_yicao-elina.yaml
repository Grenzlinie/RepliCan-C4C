claims:
- claim: An indirect band gap of 0.07 eV opens in biphenylene under 10% biaxial strain.
  instruction:
  - Construct a biphenylene monolayer unit cell.  The relaxed lattice constants are
    a = 3.761 Å and b = 4.519 Å
  - Apply 10% biaxial strain by scaling the lattice constants accordingly (a' = 1.1
    * a, b' = 1.1 * b)
  - 'Relax the atomic positions using VASP with the following settings: - Exchange-correlation:
    PBE functional - Energy cutoff: 800 eV - K-points: 6x5x1 Monkhorst-Pack grid -
    Force convergence: 10^-4 eV/Å - Energy convergence: 10^-8 eV'
  - Perform a self-consistent field (SCF) calculation using a denser k-point grid
    (11x9x1) for accurate electronic structure
  - Calculate the band structure along the high-symmetry path including Γ, Y, and
    other relevant points
  - Determine the band gap by finding the difference between the valence band maximum
    (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM). The VBM is at Y and the CBM is at Γ
  - 'Expected result: Indirect band gap of 0.07 eV'
- claim: The lightest carrier effective mass in biphenylene under 10% biaxial strain
    is 0.184 m0 for electrons along the x (Γ→X) direction.
  instruction:
  - Follow steps 1-3 from the previous claim to obtain the relaxed structure of biphenylene
    under 10% biaxial strain
  - Perform an SCF calculation with a denser k-point grid (e.g., 11x9x1)
  - Calculate the band structure along the Γ→X direction
  - Fit a parabola to the conduction band minimum near the Γ point
  - 'Calculate the effective mass using the formula: m* = ℏ² / (∂²E(k)/∂k²), where
    ℏ is the reduced Planck constant and ∂²E(k)/∂k² is the second derivative of the
    energy with respect to the wave vector k'
  - 'Expected result: 0.184 m0'
- claim: The work function of biphenylene increases to 5.05 eV under 10% biaxial strain.
  instruction:
  - Follow steps 1-3 from the first claim to obtain the relaxed structure of biphenylene
    under 10% biaxial strain
  - Perform an SCF calculation
  - Extract the Fermi energy and the average electrostatic potential in the vacuum
    region
  - Calculate the work function as the difference between the vacuum level and the
    Fermi energy
  - 'Expected result: 5.05 eV'
- claim: The Raman-active A3g phonon mode frequency in biphenylene reduces to 37.0
    THz under 10% biaxial tensile strain.
  instruction:
  - Follow steps 1-3 from the first claim to obtain the relaxed structure of biphenylene
    under 10% biaxial strain
  - Create a 2x2x1 supercell of the strained structure
  - Perform a phonon calculation using DFPT as implemented in VASP and PHONOPY with
    a 14x12x1 k-point grid
  - Extract the frequency of the A3g mode at the Γ point
  - 'Expected result: 37.0 THz'
