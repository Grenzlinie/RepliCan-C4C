claims:
non_reproducible_claims:
  - claim: "The composite-fermion Fermi sea in this Landau level is unstable to an f-wave pairing."
    reason: "reason: practical_limits
explanation: The paper uses a BCS variational wave function for composite fermions and performs numerical calculations using lattice Monte Carlo. While the theoretical framework is described, the specific implementation details and computational cost make direct reproduction challenging without access to their code and computational resources."

  - claim: "Analogous calculation suggests the possibility of a p-wave pairing of composite fermions at half filling in the n = 2 graphene Landau level, whereas no pairing instability is found at half filling in the n = 0 and 1 graphene Landau levels."
    reason: "reason: practical_limits
explanation: Similar to the previous claim, this involves complex numerical calculations with specialized techniques and potentially high computational cost, hindering straightforward reproduction."

  - claim: "The CFFS is unstable to f-wave pairing at half filling in the n = 3 graphene LL."
    reason: "reason: practical_limits
explanation: This claim is based on numerical minimization of energy using lattice Monte Carlo, which requires significant computational resources and specific implementation details not fully provided in the paper."

  - claim: "The overlap of the exact Coulomb ground in graphene at the half-filled n = 3 LL with BCS-f state is approximately 0.25 in the parameter range where the energy is minimum."
    reason: "reason: practical_limits
explanation: Calculating overlaps with the exact ground state requires exact diagonalization or other computationally intensive methods, especially for larger systems, making reproduction difficult without access to their specific implementation."

  - claim: "The lowest energy is obtained for the p-wave paired state [in the n=2 graphene LL]."
    reason: "reason: practical_limits
explanation: This is based on numerical energy minimization, similar to the other claims, and requires substantial computational resources and specific implementation details not fully disclosed."
