non_reproducible_claims:
  - claim: "PSpF doped PDPIN presents much higher air stability of σ than that of N-DMBI-doped PDPIN"
    reason: "reason: practical_limits
explanation: Requires long-term measurement (75 days) under ambient conditions."

  - claim: "The involvement of F⁻ in the doping of PDPIN:PSpF was supported by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) observation and ab initio computational calculations."
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: The claim involves EDS observation which is an experimental procedure. While the ab initio calculations are computational, the paper does not provide details allowing the claim to be computationally reproduced."
