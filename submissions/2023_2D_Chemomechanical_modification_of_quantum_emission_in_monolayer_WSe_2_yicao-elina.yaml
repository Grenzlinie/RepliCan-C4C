claims:
- claim: Physisorbed NPh oligomers on WSe2 result in nearly flat mid-gap states near
    the CBM of 1L WSe2.
  instruction:
  - Create a 4x4x1 supercell of monolayer WSe2
  - Construct NPh oligomers (1-3 rings) in various configurations (see Supplementary
    Fig. 24 of the paper)
  - Place the NPh oligomer on the WSe2 surface at an equilibrium distance of ~3.5
    Å, with the oligomer rings parallel to the surface
  - 'DFT setup in VASP: - Functional: PBE-D3BJ for geometry optimization, HSE06/SOC
    for electronic structure. - PAW pseudopotentials. - K-points: 4x4x1 Gamma-centered
    Monkhorst-Pack grid. - Energy cutoff: 520 eV. - Vacuum: 20 Å along the c-axis'
  - Relax the atomic positions until forces are below 0.01 eV/Å
  - Calculate the band structure and charge density distribution
  - 'Expected result: Nearly flat mid-gap states near the CBM, primarily localized
    on the NPh oligomers.  Type-II heterojunction formation'
- claim: 1L WSe2 with a single Se vacancy exhibits new mid-gap states near the CBM.
  instruction:
  - Create a 4x4x1 supercell of monolayer WSe2
  - Remove one Se atom to create a Se vacancy
  - 'DFT setup in VASP (same as above): - Functional: PBE-D3BJ for geometry optimization,
    HSE06/SOC for electronic structure. - PAW pseudopotentials. - K-points: 4x4x1
    Gamma-centered Monkhorst-Pack grid. - Energy cutoff: 520 eV. - Vacuum: 20 Å along
    the c-axis'
  - Relax the atomic positions until forces are below 0.01 eV/Å
  - Calculate the band structure and charge density distribution
  - 'Expected result: New mid-gap states near the CBM, localized on the W atoms surrounding
    the Se vacancy'
- claim: 1% biaxial strain increases the band gap of pristine WSe2 by ~0.08 eV.
  instruction:
  - Create a 4x4x1 supercell of pristine monolayer WSe2
  - Apply 1% biaxial strain along the a and b axes
  - 'DFT setup in VASP (same as above): - Functional: PBE-D3BJ for geometry optimization,
    HSE06/SOC for electronic structure. - PAW pseudopotentials. - K-points: 4x4x1
    Gamma-centered Monkhorst-Pack grid. - Energy cutoff: 520 eV. - Vacuum: 20 Å along
    the c-axis'
  - Relax the atomic positions until forces are below 0.01 eV/Å
  - Calculate the band structure
  - Compare the band gap with the unstrained case
  - 'Expected result: Band gap increase of ~0.08 eV compared to the unstrained case'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: 4-NBD treatment quenches most strain-induced defect emission, resulting in
    sharp SPEs with high single-photon purity.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: This claim involves experimental
    measurements of photoluminescence and second-order correlation function, which
    are not directly reproducible through DFT calculations.'
- claim: The NPh oligomer film is ~4.4 nm thick.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: This is an experimental measurement
    obtained from AFM scratching.'
- claim: The emitter lifetime is (2.34 ± 0.13) ns.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: This is an experimental measurement
    obtained from time-resolved photoluminescence.'
