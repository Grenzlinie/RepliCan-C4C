claims:
  - claim: "Monolayer WS2 exhibits a room-temperature hole mobility of 3021 cm^2/Vs at a carrier concentration of 10^10 cm^-2."
    instruction:
      - "1. Obtain the crystal structure of monolayer WS2 (can be generated from the 3D bulk structure)"
      - "DFT setup in Quantum Espresso:
   - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional
   - Pseudopotentials: Optimized Norm-Conserving Pseudopotentials (ONCV) from PseudoDojo
   - K-points: Coarse grid for electron-phonon coupling (see Table 1 in the paper) and dense grid for transport calculations (converged, see Table 1 in the paper)
   - Kinetic energy cutoff: As recommended in the PseudoDojo library for the chosen pseudopotentials.
   - 2D Coulomb truncation: Use the approach of ref. 170.
   - Spin-orbit coupling: Included"
      - "Relax atomic positions until forces < 10^-5 Ry/bohr"

      - "Solve the Boltzmann transport equation using EPW with adaptive smearing (refs. 16, 183)"
      - "Set temperature to 300 K and carrier concentration to 10^10 cm^-2"
      - "Expected result: ~3021 cm^2/Vs"

  - claim: "The hole mobility of WS2 is significantly enhanced by spin-orbit coupling (SOC)."
    instruction:

      - "Perform the calculation both with and without SOC"
      - "Compare the resulting hole mobilities"
      - "Expected result: Mobility with SOC is significantly higher than without SOC (see Fig. 16b in the paper)"

  - claim: "Including GW corrections, a higher carrier concentration of 10^13 cm^-2, and quadrupole corrections, the hole mobility of WS2 is estimated to be 1342 cm^2/Vs at 300 K."
    instruction:
      - "1. Obtain the relaxed structure from the first claim"
      - "Perform GW calculations using BerkeleyGW with the parameters specified in the "Methods" section"
      - "Use the GW band structure to calculate effective masses and electron-phonon matrix elements"
      - "Include quadrupole corrections using the method of ref. 27"
      - "Solve the Boltzmann transport equation using EPW with the updated band structure, matrix elements, and a carrier concentration of 10^13 cm^-2"
      - "Expected result: ~1342 cm^2/Vs"

non_reproducible_claims:
  - claim: "Experimental hole mobilities reported for WS2 are much lower than the calculated intrinsic mobility."
    reason: "reason: practical_limits
explanation: Requires device fabrication and electrical measurements, which are influenced by various extrinsic factors like defects, contact resistance, and substrate effects."

  - claim: "The realization of Ohmic contacts using degenerately p-doped 2D Mo0.995Nb0.005S2 could lead to higher measured hole mobilities in WS2 devices."
    reason: "reason: practical_limits
explanation: Requires specific device fabrication and material synthesis techniques."

  - claim: "Remote phonon scattering from the gate dielectric and substrate can significantly reduce the hole mobility of WS2 in practical devices."
    reason: "reason: practical_limits
explanation: Requires considering the specific dielectric environment in device simulations, which is beyond the scope of the presented calculations."
