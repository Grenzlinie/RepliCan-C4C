claims:
  - claim: "Uni-Mol+ achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.0617 eV on the PCQM4MV2 validation set for HOMO-LUMO gap prediction."
    instruction:
      - "1. Obtain the PCQM4MV2 dataset (from the OGB Large-Scale Challenge)"
      - "Generate 8 initial 3D conformations for each molecule using RDKit's ETKDG method and MMFF94 force field optimization. For molecules where 3D generation fails, create 2D conformations"
      - "Implement the Uni-Mol+ model as described in the "Method" section of the paper, including the two-track Transformer backbone, OuterProduct, TriangularUpdate, and iterative coordinate updates"
      - "Train the model using the AdamW optimizer with the specified hyperparameters (learning rate 2e-4, batch size 1024, etc.) for 1.5 million steps. Use the described noisy interpolation training strategy with a mixture of Bernoulli and Uniform distributions for sampling q"
      - "During inference, average the HOMO-LUMO gap predictions across the 8 conformations for each molecule"
      - "Expected result: MAE of 0.0617 eV on the validation set"

  - claim: "Uni-Mol+ achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.412 eV on the OC20 IS2RE test set for relaxed energy prediction."
    instruction:
      - "1. Obtain the OC20 IS2RE dataset"
      - "Implement the Uni-Mol+ model, adapting it for the OC20 dataset by excluding graph-related features and adjusting the model capacity as described in the paper. Implement periodic boundary conditions handling as described"
      - "Train the model using the AdamW optimizer with the specified hyperparameters (learning rate 2e-4, batch size 64, etc.) for 1.5 million steps. Use the noisy interpolation training strategy"
      - "Evaluate the model on the test set"
      - "Expected result: MAE of 0.412 eV on the test set"

non_reproducible_claims:
  - claim: "Visualized analysis shows Uni-Mol+ effectively predicts equilibrium conformations with decreasing RMSD as iterations increase."
    reason: "reason: data_unavailable
explanation: The DFT conformations used for comparison in Figure 2 are not publicly available in the PCQM4MV2 dataset and were generated by the authors. The specific DFT settings used are not fully detailed, making precise reproduction difficult."

  - claim: "Uni-Mol+ predicts conformations with lower energies, approaching equilibrium conformations, as shown by the energy difference distribution in Figure 3."
    reason: "reason: data_unavailable
explanation: Similar to the previous claim, the DFT calculations for energy comparison in Figure 3 are based on author-generated conformations and not fully specified DFT settings, hindering exact reproduction."
