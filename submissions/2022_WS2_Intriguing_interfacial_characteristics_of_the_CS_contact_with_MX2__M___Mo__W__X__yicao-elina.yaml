claims:
- claim: Binding energy of CS-MoS2 in stacking (b) is -0.50 eV.
  instruction:
  - Construct the CS-MoS2 heterostructure in stacking (b) as described in Figure 1
    and the paper text
  - 'DFT setup in VASP: - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional - K-points: 6x6x1 Monkhorst-Pack
    grid - Energy cutoff: 500 eV - Grimme D3 van der Waals correction'
  - Relax atomic positions until forces < 1e-4 eV/Å and energy < 1e-5 eV
  - 'Calculate binding energy: Eb = E(CS-MoS2) - E(CS) - E(MoS2)'
  - 'Expected result: -0.50 eV'
- claim: CS-MoS2 shows a tiny band gap opening after stacking.
  instruction:
  - Use the relaxed structure of CS-MoS2 from the previous calculation
  - 'DFT setup in VASP: - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional - K-points: 12x12x1
    Monkhorst-Pack grid - Energy cutoff: 500 eV - Grimme D3 van der Waals correction'
  - Perform a self-consistent field (SCF) calculation
  - Calculate the band structure
  - Observe a small band gap opening around the Dirac point of CS.  The exact value
    is not specified in the paper, but the opening is qualitatively mentioned
- claim: CS-WS2 and CS-MoSeTe have smaller effective masses compared to other investigated
    heterostructures.
  instruction:
  - Use relaxed structures of the various CS-MX2 and CS-MXY heterostructures
  - DFT setup in VASP (as described in previous instructions)
  - Perform SCF calculations
  - Calculate the band structure
  - Fit a parabola to the band edges (CBM and VBM) to extract the effective masses
    using the formula m* = ħ^2 / (d^2E/dk^2)
  - Compare the effective masses of CS-WS2 and CS-MoSeTe with other heterostructures.
    The paper claims they are smaller, but doesn't provide exact numerical values
    for all cases
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: These heterostructures can be utilized for hole/electron separation.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: While effective mass differences
    suggest potential for charge separation, this claim requires further calculations
    or simulations beyond the scope of the provided computational details (e.g., device
    simulations) to quantify and confirm.'
- claim: The CS-MX2 and CS-MXY heterostructures exhibit intense absorption peaks near
    the visible region.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: While the paper mentions calculating
    the imaginary part of the dielectric function using the BSE and GW methods with
    Quantum Espresso, the specific parameters and setup for these calculations are
    not provided, making it difficult to reproduce the optical spectra.'
- claim: The MS contact of CS with MX2 and MXY leads to the formation of p-type Schottky
    contacts.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: While Schottky barrier heights are
    calculated, confirming the p-type nature and practical device performance requires
    further device-level simulations and experimental validation.'
