claims:
  - claim: "Pd-Ni catalyst provokes the utmost H2 activity"
    instruction:
      - "1. Perform DFT calculations to determine the reaction energy for 2H* -> H2 on Pd-Ni(111) surface"
      - "Compare the reaction energy to other M-Ni SAA catalysts"
      - "The expected result is that Pd-Ni exhibits the lowest endothermic reaction energy for this step"

  - claim: "Cu-Ni site to effectively desorb hydrogen compared to Pd-Ni and Ni at 873 K"
    instruction:
      - "1. Perform AIMD simulations at 873 K on Ni(111), Pd-Ni(111), and Cu-Ni(111) surfaces with adsorbed hydrogen"
      - "Observe the dynamic behavior of hydrogen atoms over a 5 ps time interval"
      - "Cu-Ni should show H2 desorption, while Ni and Pd-Ni surfaces retain dissociated hydrogen"
      - "Calculate the H2 desorption free reaction energy (ΔGdes, H2) and compare it for the different surfaces. Cu-Ni should have the lowest ΔGdes, H2 (~0.24 eV lower than Ni)"

  - claim: "Ni4-MgCr2O4 catalyst offers superior hydrogen production while mitigating coke deposition (referenced from Ding et al.7)"
    instruction:
      - "This claim cannot be directly reproduced from the provided paper text as it refers to an external experimental study (Ding et al.7).  The paper utilizes this as context but doesn't provide the specifics to reproduce the experimental findings computationally"

  - claim: "Zn and Cu enhanced the nickel-based catalyst’s tolerance to coking (referenced from Wang et al.15)"
    instruction:
      - "1. Calculate 4C* chain clustering reaction energy (ΔErxn, 4C) for Zn-Ni, Cu-Ni, and pure Ni"
      - "Zn-Ni and Cu-Ni should exhibit less negative ΔErxn, 4C values (-0.54 eV and -0.88 eV) compared to Ni (-2.01 eV), indicating higher coking tolerance"
      - "This information validates an external experimental study mentioned in the paper and uses it as a point of comparison for their computational findings"

  - claim: "Six promising trimetallic M1-M2-Ni catalysts: Ag-Sc-Ni, Au-Sc-Ni, Au-Zn-Ni, Au-Zr-Ni, Au-Pd-Ni, and Au-Hf-Ni achieve high H2 formation activity, accompanied with improved coke-resistant ability."
    instruction:
      - "1. Calculate H* adsorption energy (Eads, H) and C* adsorption energy (Eads, C) for the six mentioned trimetallic catalysts and Ni(111)"
      - "The trimetallic catalysts should exhibit Eads, H > -0.5 eV (weaker binding for H2 formation) and Eads, C > -6.0 eV (weaker binding, indicating coke resistance), where these thresholds are based on the dataset generated in the study and are relative to the pure Ni values"
      - "Compare the calculated adsorption energies with those of Ni(111). The six listed trimetallic catalysts should have less negative values for both Eads, H and Eads, C, indicating improved performance"
