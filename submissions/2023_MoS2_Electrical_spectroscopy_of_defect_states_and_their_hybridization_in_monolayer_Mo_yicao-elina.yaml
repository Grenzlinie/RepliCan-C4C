claims:
- claim: Single sulfur vacancies (VS) exhibit energy levels 0.5–0.6 eV below EC (conduction
    band minimum).
  instruction:
  - Create a 5x5 supercell of monolayer MoS2
  - Remove one sulfur atom to create a single sulfur vacancy (VS)
  - 'DFT setup in VASP: - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional - Pseudopotentials:
    PAW - K-points: 3x3x1 Monkhorst-Pack grid - Energy cutoff: 400 eV - Spin-orbit
    coupling: Included'
  - Relax atomic positions and lattice constants until energy change < 1e-5 eV and
    forces < 0.01 eV/Å
  - Calculate the electronic density of states (DOS)
  - Determine the energy level of the defect state relative to the conduction band
    minimum from the DOS
  - 'Expected result: 0.5-0.6 eV below EC'
- claim: Double sulfur vacancies (VS2) have nearly the same energy levels as VS inside
    the gap, around 0.5-0.6 eV below EC.
  instruction:
  - Create a 5x5 supercell of monolayer MoS2
  - Remove two sulfur atoms (top and bottom layer sulfur of the same Mo) to create
    a double sulfur vacancy (VS2)
  - Use the same DFT setup as for the single sulfur vacancy calculation (PBE, PAW,
    3x3x1 k-points, 400 eV cutoff, spin-orbit coupling)
  - Relax atomic positions and lattice constants
  - Calculate the DOS
  - Determine the energy level of the defect state relative to the conduction band
    minimum
  - 'Expected result: ~0.5-0.6 eV below EC'
- claim: Neighboring sulfur vacancy pairs (VSVS, 1NN) create four in-gap hybridized
    defect states with energies distributed between 0.2 eV and 0.7 eV below EC.
  instruction:
  - Create a 5x5 supercell of monolayer MoS2
  - Remove two neighboring sulfur atoms in the same plane to create the VSVS defect
  - Use the same DFT setup as for the single and double sulfur vacancy calculations
  - Relax atomic positions and lattice constants
  - Calculate the DOS
  - Determine the energy levels of the defect states relative to the conduction band
    minimum
  - 'Expected result: Four defect states between 0.2 and 0.7 eV below EC'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: DLTS measurements reveal two distinct trap states, T1 and T2, at 0.23 eV
    and 0.63 eV below EC, respectively.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: Raw DLTS data and specific parameters
    for the FT-DLTS analysis are not provided, making it difficult to reproduce the
    exact peak positions and analysis.'
- claim: STEM imaging reveals the presence of VS, VS2, and VSVS defects.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: Requires experimental STEM measurements.'
- claim: Ar plasma treatment increases the DLTS signal and shifts the peaks, indicating
    an increase in sulfur vacancy concentration.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: Requires experimental plasma treatment
    and DLTS measurements.'
- claim: The T1 trap state has a narrower linewidth (72 meV) than the T2 state (232
    meV).
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: Requires access to the raw DLTS data
    and the specific pulse parameters used for the linewidth analysis.'
