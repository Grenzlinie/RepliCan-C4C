claims:
  - claim: "Initial growth velocity of GaN on c-plane was 3.37 m/s in a stoichiometric melt simulation, decaying to an average of 0.11 m/s over the last 1 ns of a 5 ns simulation."
    instruction:
      - "1. Set up a "sandwich" simulation box as described in Figure 1a with a four-layer c-plane GaN substrate, vacuum regions, and a stoichiometric (50:50) mix of 2000 Ga and 2000 N atoms randomly placed in the vacuum"
      - "Fix the central two layers of the substrate"
      - "Run an NVT MD simulation at 2000 K for 5 ns using the FLARE force field within LAMMPS"
      - "Calculate the growth velocity using eq 1 and eq 2.  The initial velocity should be around 3.37 m/s, decaying to an average of 0.11 m/s over the last 1 ns"

  - claim: "The extrapolated growth velocity (Vinf) on the c-plane was 0.145 m/s in the stoichiometric melt simulation."
    instruction:
      - "1. Follow steps 1-4 from the previous claim"
      - "Fit the growth velocity to an exponential decay function as defined in eq 3"
      - "The fitted Vinf value should be approximately 0.145 m/s"

  - claim: "The diffusivity of a single nitrogen atom in a gallium melt was estimated to be between 8.12 × 10−8 and 1.47 × 10−4 cm²/s over a temperature range of 500-2000 K."
    instruction:
      - "1. Equilibrate a gallium melt in an NPT ensemble at 1 bar for 1 ns"
      - "Place a single nitrogen atom in the system"
      - "Run NVT MD simulations at various temperatures between 500 K and 2000 K for 10 ns"
      - "Calculate the diffusivity of nitrogen in the gallium melt for each temperature.  The values should fall within the range of 8.12 × 10−8 to 1.47 × 10−4 cm²/s"

  - claim: "In diffusion-limited growth simulations, the extrapolated growth velocity (Vinf) was on the order of 10⁻⁴ m/s for a-, c-, and m-planes."
    instruction:
      - "1. Set up a non-periodic simulation box as shown in Figure 1b with the chosen plane (a-, c-, or m-) exposed"
      - "Fill the vacuum region with Ga and N atoms at a 3:1 ratio"
      - "Replenish nitrogen atoms above the liquid gallium every 200 ps with a minimum interatomic distance of 2 Å"
      - "Run the simulation and analyze the growth rate"
      - "Fit the growth velocity data to an exponential decay (eq 3) to determine Vinf. The value should be on the order of 10⁻⁴ m/s for each plane"

  - claim: "The surface energies for a-, c-, and m-planes were calculated as 0.0631 eV/Å², 0.0581 eV/Å², and 0.0731 eV/Å² respectively."
    instruction:
      - "1. Create a slab of at least 20 layers of the desired plane (a-, c-, or m-)"
      - "Add 10 Å of vacuum perpendicular to the plane"
      - "Run a surface energy scan in LAMMPS at 0 K"
      - "Calculate the surface energy using the formula σsurface = Esurface −N × EGa−N pair, where N is the total number of atoms divided by two"
      - "The calculated values should be approximately 0.0631 eV/Å² for a-plane, 0.0581 eV/Å² for c-plane, and 0.0731 eV/Å² for m-plane"
