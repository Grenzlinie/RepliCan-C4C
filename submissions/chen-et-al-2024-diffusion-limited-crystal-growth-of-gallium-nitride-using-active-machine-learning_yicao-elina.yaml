claims:
  - claim: "Nitrogen diffusion through Ga is slow, with diffusivity between 8.12e-8 and 1.47e-4 cm^2/s over a temperature range of 500-2000K."
    instruction:
      - "1. Equilibrate a Ga melt in NPT ensemble at 1 bar for 1 ns"
      - "Introduce a single N atom into the equilibrated Ga melt"
      - "Perform NVT MD simulations at various temperatures (500-2000 K) for 10 ns"
      - "Track the mean squared displacement (MSD) of the N atom over time"
      - "Calculate the diffusion coefficient using the Einstein relation: D = MSD/(6t), where t is time"
      - "Expected result: Diffusivity values within the specified range depending on the temperature"

  - claim: "Nitrogen tends to phase-segregate within liquid Ga."
    instruction:
      - "1. Set up a simulation box containing liquid Ga and N atoms (e.g., ratios of 2:1 or 3:1 Ga/N)"
      - "Perform NVT MD simulations at elevated temperatures (e.g., 2200 K) for several nanoseconds (e.g., 5 ns)"
      - "Visually inspect the simulation snapshots for evidence of N clustering or "bubble" formation"
      - "Calculate the radial distribution function (RDF) for Ga-Ga and N-N pairs"
      - "Observe an increase in Ga-Ga coordination number and a distinct N-N peak in the RDF, indicating phase separation"

  - claim: "Crystal growth velocity decays rapidly from initial values of ~3 m/s to ~0.1 m/s within the first nanosecond of simulation in a stoichiometric melt."
    instruction:
      - "1. Create a "sandwich" structure with a few layers of wurtzite GaN substrate, liquid Ga, and N atoms above and below the substrate in stoichiometric proportions"
      - "Fix the central layers of the GaN substrate"
      - "Perform NVT MD simulations at 2000 K for 5 ns"
      - "Track the thickness of the crystallized GaN layer over time"
      - "Calculate the growth velocity using the change in thickness over time"
      - "Observe an initial rapid growth followed by a sharp decay in velocity within the first nanosecond"

non_reproducible_claims:
  - claim: "Experimental growth velocity for GaN is 0.03-0.7 Î¼m/min."
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: This is an experimental measurement and cannot be directly reproduced through computation."

  - claim: "The m-plane has the highest growth velocity compared to the a- and c-planes in diffusion-limited growth."
    reason: "reason: practical_limits
explanation: While the paper mentions this observation, the difference in growth rates is small (~10%) and may be within the statistical uncertainty of the MD simulations.  Reproducing this claim requires extensive simulations and careful analysis of growth profiles, which is practically challenging."

  - claim: "The m-plane exhibits the roughest surface growth while the a-plane has the smoothest."
    reason: "reason: practical_limits
explanation: Similar to the growth velocity claim, the differences in surface roughness may be subtle and require extensive simulations to definitively reproduce."
