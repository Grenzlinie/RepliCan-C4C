  - claim: "The MoS2/MoO3 interface has a reduced band gap of ~0.22 eV (GGA) and 0.51 eV (HSE)."
    instruction:
      - "1. Construct a MoS2/MoO3 interface using MoS2 (001) and MoO3 (010) monolayers"

  - claim: "Oxygen vacancy in MoO3 creates defect states close to the CBM."

      - "DFT setup in VASP (similar to previous calculations)"
      - "Perform SCF calculation"
      - "Calculate DOS"
      - "Analyze the DOS for defect states near the CBM"

non_reproducible_claims:
  - claim: "MoOx has a work function of ~6.67 eV."
    reason: "reason: practical_limits
explanation: Work function calculations are sensitive to slab setup and vacuum size, making precise reproduction challenging without the exact setup details."

  - claim: "Oxygen vacancy formation energy is ~2 eV lower than Mo vacancy."
    reason: "reason: practical_limits
explanation: Formation energy depends on the chemical potentials of Mo and O, which are not explicitly provided in the paper, making precise reproduction difficult."

  - claim: "MoS2/MoOx interface shows Ohmic behavior."
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: Ohmic behavior is an electrical property that requires transport calculations or experiments, not directly obtainable from the presented DFT calculations."

  - claim: "Experimental observations confirm the p-type contact behavior of MoOx with MoS2 and WSe2."
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: This claim relies on experimental validation, which is outside the scope of DFT calculations."
