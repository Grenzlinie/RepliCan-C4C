      - "Calculate cohesive energy: Ec = (E_total - 2*E_C - 2*E_P) / 4, where E_total is the total energy of the unit cell, E_C and E_P are the energies of isolated C and P atoms, respectively"
      - "Expected result: -5.46 eV/atom"

  - claim: "GaSe-like monolayer PC has a direct band gap of 1.80 eV (PBE) and 2.65 eV (HSE06)."
    instruction:
      - "1. Use the relaxed structure from the previous calculation"
      - "DFT setup in VASP:
   - Exchange-correlation: PBE or HSE06 functional
   - Pseudopotentials: PAW
   - Kinetic energy cutoff: 500 eV
   - K-points: Not explicitly mentioned, needs convergence testing"

      - "Expected result: 1.80 eV (PBE), 2.65 eV (HSE06)"

  - claim: "One carbon vacancy (VC) in a 4x4x1 supercell of GaSe-like monolayer PC induces a magnetic moment of 1.22 µB."
    instruction:
      - "1. Construct a 4x4x1 supercell of GaSe-like monolayer PC (64 atoms)"
      - "Remove one carbon atom to create a vacancy"
      - "DFT setup in VASP:
   - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional with vdW corrections
   - Pseudopotentials: PAW
   - Kinetic energy cutoff: 500 eV
   - K-points: likely Gamma-centered, needs convergence testing.
   - Spin-polarized calculation"
      - "Relax atomic positions until forces < 0.01 eV/Å and energy change < 10⁻⁵ eV"
      - "Extract the total magnetic moment"
      - "Expected result: 1.22 µB"

non_reproducible_claims:
  - claim: "The 2D PC monolayer can be a promising candidate for photocatalytic water splitting."
    reason: "reason: practical_limits
explanation: While band edge alignments and optical absorption are calculated, actual photocatalytic activity requires further investigation and experimental validation."

  - claim: "The 2D PC may possess a higher electronic mobility than the 2H-MoS2 monolayer."
    reason: "reason: practical_limits
explanation: Effective masses are calculated, but mobility depends on other factors and requires more complex calculations or experimental measurements."
