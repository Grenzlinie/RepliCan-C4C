claims:
  - claim: "Li adsorption on pristine graphene is unstable at all coverages examined (1/32, 3/32, 5/32 ML)."
    instruction:
      - "1. Create a 4x4x1 supercell of pristine graphene (32 C atoms)"
      - "Place 1, 3, or 5 Li atoms at various initial positions above the graphene sheet (hollow site for 1/32 ML)"
      - "DFT setup in CRYSTAL17:
   - Functional: PBE0
   - Basis sets: pob-TZVP for C, 6s3p1d for Li
   - Grimme D2 dispersion correction
   - K-points: 12x12x1 Monkhorst-Pack grid for geometry optimization
   - SCF energy threshold: 10^-9 Hartrees"
      - "Perform geometry optimization"
      - "Calculate adsorption energy (E_ads) using Equation (1) in the paper"
      - "Expected result: E_ads < 1.63 eV/Li (less negative than bulk Li binding energy) for all coverages"

  - claim: "Na adsorption on pristine graphene is unstable at all coverages examined (1/32, 3/32, 5/32 ML)."
    instruction:
      - "1. Create a 4x4x1 supercell of pristine graphene (32 C atoms)"
      - "Place 1, 3, or 5 Na atoms at various initial positions above the graphene sheet (hollow site for 1/32 ML)"

   - Grimme D2 dispersion correction
   - K-points: 12x12x1 Monkhorst-Pack grid for geometry optimization

      - "Perform geometry optimization"
      - "Calculate adsorption energy (E_ads) using Equation (1) in the paper"
      - "Expected result: E_ads < 1.13 eV/Na (less negative than bulk Na binding energy) for all coverages"

  - claim: "Li adsorption on single vacancy defective graphene is stable and has some covalent character."
    instruction:
      - "1. Create a 4x4x1 supercell of graphene (32 C atoms)"
      - "Introduce a single vacancy by removing one C atom and replacing it with a "ghost" atom"
      - "Place a Li atom above the vacancy"
      - "DFT setup in CRYSTAL17 (same as for Li on pristine graphene)"
      - "Perform geometry optimization"
      - "Calculate E_ads (Equation 1), COOP for Li-C, QTAIM properties at Li-C bond critical point, and ELF"
      - "Expected result: E_ads > 1.63 eV/Li, significant COOP value, QTAIM and ELF indicators of covalent character"

  - claim: "Graphene oxide (GO) with O/C = 43.75% has a band gap of 4.40 eV."
    instruction:
      - "1. Create a 4x4x1 supercell of graphene"
      - "Introduce epoxides and hydroxyls to achieve O/C = 43.75% (25% epoxides, 18.75% hydroxyls relative to C), following the structure proposed by Zhou and Bongiorno [46]"
      - "DFT setup in CRYSTAL17 (same as for adsorption calculations, but without adsorbates)"
      - "Perform geometry optimization"
      - "Calculate band structure"
      - "Expected result: Band gap of 4.40 eV"

non_reproducible_claims:
  - claim: "Increased LIB graphene capacities relative to graphite seem indicative of increased Li atoms being adsorbed on graphene relative to graphite."
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: Relates to experimental LIB capacity measurements."

  - claim: "The contrary has been observed via in situ Raman spectroscopy."
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: Requires experimental Raman measurements."

  - claim: "Li forms clusters due to the small Li diffusion barrier on graphene support."
    reason: "reason: practical_limits
explanation: Diffusion barrier calculations are computationally demanding, especially for larger systems."

  - claim: "Temperature and pressure effects will be described in a future work."
    reason: "reason: data_unavailable
explanation: Not included in the current paper."
