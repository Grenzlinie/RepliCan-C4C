claims:
- claim: The complex emits a maximum at 509 nm.
  instruction:
  - This claim is based on experimental photoluminescence measurements and cannot
    be directly reproduced with DFT calculations as described in the paper.  While
    DFT can be used to calculate excitation energies, the level of theory used in
    this paper (B3LYP/LanL2DZ with Gaussian 09) is not generally sufficient for accurate
    prediction of emission wavelengths, especially for transition metal complexes.  Furthermore,
    the paper does not provide the necessary details (e.g., excited state calculations)
    to reproduce this claim computationally
- claim: HOMO and LUMO energies values of the complex were calculated as -4.98 eV
    and -2.17 eV, respectively. The energy gap between HOMO and LUMO was computed
    as 2.81 eV.
  instruction:
  - Build the structure of the Cd(II) coordination polymer {[Cd(µ-fdc)(H2O)(µ-bib)]·H2O}n
    using the crystallographic information provided in the paper (Table 1 and supplementary
    information)
  - Perform a geometry optimization using Gaussian 09 with the B3LYP functional and
    the LanL2DZ basis set (with ECP for Cd).  Use the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set for
    other atoms
  - After geometry optimization, perform a single-point energy calculation at the
    same level of theory to obtain the HOMO and LUMO energies
  - The expected HOMO energy is -4.98 eV, the LUMO energy is -2.17 eV, and the HOMO-LUMO
    gap is 2.81 eV.  Note that these values are obtained with a relatively small basis
    set and a functional that is not known for accurate band gap predictions.  Therefore,
    some deviation from these values is possible
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: The complex shows semi-conductor properties according to the solid-state
    UV–Vis diffuse reflection spectra results.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: This claim is based on experimental
    UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and the Kubelka-Munk analysis, which are
    not computational methods.'
- claim: The thermal decomposition product is CdO.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: This claim is based on experimental
    thermal analysis (TG/DTA) and is not a computational result.'
- claim: Topologically, complex 1 is a uninodal (4)-connected 2D structure and displays
    sql topology with the point symbol of {44.62}.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: While this claim is based on topological
    analysis, the specific details and data required to reproduce this analysis (e.g.,
    CIF file or detailed structural information) are not provided in the main text
    or readily available supplementary information.'
