claims:
  - claim: "The optimized lattice parameter of monolayer (1L) MoS2 is 3.19 Å and the bandgap of 1L MoS2 is 1.64 eV."
    instruction:
      - "1. Create a unit cell of monolayer MoS2"
      - "DFT setup in VASP:
   - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional
   - Pseudopotentials: PAW
   - K-points: 11×11×1 
   - Energy cutoff: 500 eV
   - vdW correction: Grimme D3"
      - "Relax atomic positions and cell volume until forces < 0.01 eV/Å and energy convergence criterion is 10−5 eV"
      - "Extract the optimized lattice parameter and band gap"
      - "Expected results: lattice parameter = 3.19 Å, band gap = 1.64 eV"

  - claim: "The pinning factor S of 1L MoS2-metal close interfaces is 0.37."
    instruction:
      - "1. Construct MoS2-metal close interfaces using six layers of metal atoms (Al, Ag, Cu, Au, Pd, and Pt in (111) orientation) with (√3 × √3) R30◦MoS2/(2 × 2) metal surfaces supercell matching"
      - "DFT setup in VASP (same as above)"
      - "Calculate SBH for each metal interface"
      - "Calculate pinning factor S = dΦB/dWM"
      - "Expected result: S = 0.37"

  - claim: "The pinning factor S of 1L MoS2-metal vdW interfaces is 0.49."
    instruction:
      - "1. Construct MoS2-metal vdW interfaces with interlayer distances dvdW = RvdW_S + RvdW_metal"
      - "DFT setup in VASP (same as above)"
      - "Calculate SBH for each metal interface"
      - "Calculate pinning factor S = dΦB/dWM"
      - "Expected result: S = 0.49"

non_reproducible_claims:
  - claim: "MoS2-Al (or Ag or Cu) has a small n-SBH (0.15–0.25 eV), which ensures the low contact resistance that is observed experimentally."
    reason: "reason: experimental_validation
explanation: Requires experimental measurements of contact resistance."

  - claim: "A low p-SBH of 0.11 eV can be achieved in the 4L MoS2-Pt vdW interface, suggesting the presence of low contact resistance in MoS2-based electrical devices."
    reason: "reason: experimental_validation
explanation: Requires experimental measurements of contact resistance in devices."
