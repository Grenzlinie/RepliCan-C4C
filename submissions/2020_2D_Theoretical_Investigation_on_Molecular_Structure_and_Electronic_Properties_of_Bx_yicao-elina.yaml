claims:
- claim: BLi molecule has a bond length of 2.437 Å.
  instruction:
  - Create a BLi molecule
  - DFT setup in Quantum Espresso with PBE functional
  - Relax atomic positions
  - Extract the B-Li bond length
  - 'Expected result: 2.437 Å'
- claim: BLi molecule has a binding energy per atom of 0.818640424 eV.
  instruction:
  - Create a BLi molecule
  - DFT setup in Quantum Espresso with PBE functional
  - Relax atomic positions
  - Calculate the total energy of BLi (E_BLi), B (E_B), and Li (E_Li)
  - 'Calculate binding energy per atom using the formula: E_b = [E_B + E_Li - E_BLi]/2'
  - 'Expected result: 0.818640424 eV'
- claim: BLi molecule has a HOMO-LUMO gap of 0.3392 eV.
  instruction:
  - Create a BLi molecule
  - DFT setup in Quantum Espresso with PBE functional
  - Relax atomic positions
  - Perform a self-consistent field (SCF) calculation
  - Extract the HOMO and LUMO energies
  - Calculate the HOMO-LUMO gap as the difference between LUMO and HOMO energies
  - 'Expected result: 0.3392 eV'
- claim: BLi2 second isomer has a B-Li bond length of 2.324 Å and a Li-Li distance
    of 2.921 Å.
  instruction:
  - Create a BLi2 molecule in the second isomer configuration (bent geometry)
  - DFT setup in Quantum Espresso with PBE functional
  - Relax atomic positions
  - Extract the B-Li and Li-Li distances
  - 'Expected results: B-Li = 2.324 Å, Li-Li = 2.921 Å'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: BxLiy clusters could be an acceptable strategy to improve the ability of
    studied nanostructures as new materials of energy storage.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Requires further research and experimental
    validation beyond the scope of the provided computational details.'
- claim: The LiB clusters do not act as an expectation stability because of highly
    coordinated boron atoms.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: The paper mentions this conclusion
    based on Density of States (DOS) and Band structure calculations, but the specific
    details and data required to reproduce these calculations are not provided.'
