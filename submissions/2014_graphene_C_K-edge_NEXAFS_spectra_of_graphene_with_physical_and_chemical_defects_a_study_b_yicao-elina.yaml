claims:
  - claim: "The p* resonance at 285.4 eV in pristine graphene NEXAFS spectrum."
    instruction:
      - "1. Create a 7x7x1 supercell of pristine graphene (98 atoms)"
      - "DFT setup in Quantum Espresso:
   - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional
   - Pseudopotentials:  norm-conserving pseudopotentials of the Martinsâ€“Troullier type (C.pbe-mt_gipaw.UPF)
   - K-points: 4x4x1 Monkhorst-Pack grid for SCF, 10x10x1 for NEXAFS
   - Kinetic energy cutoff: 60 Ry"
      - "Relax atomic positions and cell parameters at the Gamma point"
      - "Calculate NEXAFS spectrum using XSpectra.
   - Core-hole pseudopotential: C.star1s-pbe-mt_gipaw.UPF
   - Broadening factor: 0.2 eV"
      - "Shift the calculated spectrum to align the p* resonance with 285.4 eV"
      - "Expected result: A sharp peak at 285.4 eV"

  - claim: "Stone-Wales defect reduces the intensity of the p* resonance and introduces new resonances in the 'fingerprint' region (286-290 eV)."
    instruction:
      - "1. Create a 7x7x1 supercell of pristine graphene"
      - "Introduce a Stone-Wales defect by rotating a C-C bond by 90 degrees"
      - "Follow steps 2-5 from the previous claim"
      - "Expected result: Reduced p* intensity and new peaks in the fingerprint region, varying depending on the C atom where the core hole is created"

  - claim: "Single-vacancy defect reduces the intensity of the p* and s* resonances and introduces new resonances in the 'fingerprint' region."
    instruction:
      - "1. Create a 7x7x1 supercell of pristine graphene"
      - "Introduce a single-vacancy defect by removing a C atom and saturating dangling bonds with two H atoms"
      - "Follow steps 2-5 from the first claim"
      - "Expected result: Reduced p* and s* intensities and new peaks in the fingerprint region"

non_reproducible_claims:
  - claim: "Experimental NEXAFS spectra of HOPG treated with bromine and krypton plasmas show characteristic changes."
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: Requires experimental setup for plasma treatment and NEXAFS measurements."

  - claim: "Br 3d XPS spectra show two Br species at binding energies of 70.5 eV and 68.4 eV."
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: Requires experimental XPS measurements."

  - claim: "Bromination with Br2 plasma leads to a decrease in the p* signal and an increase in the s* resonance in experimental NEXAFS spectra."
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: Requires experimental setup for plasma treatment and NEXAFS measurements."
