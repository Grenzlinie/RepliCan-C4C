claims:
- claim: Pristine MoS2 quantum dots have an energy gap of ~3 eV.
  instruction:
  - Construct a hexagonal MoS2 quantum dot with armchair edges (63 atoms, as shown
    in Figure 1a of the paper).  The exact atomic coordinates are not provided, but
    the paper mentions using Gaussian16, suggesting the initial structure might have
    been created using a graphical interface or a separate structure generation tool
  - 'DFT setup in Gaussian 16: - Functional: M06-2X - Basis set: LANL2DZ - SCF convergence
    criterion: 10^-4'
  - Optimize the structure fully
  - Calculate the electronic density of states (DOS)
  - Extract the energy gap from the DOS
  - 'Expected result: ~3 eV'
- claim: Edge passivation with sulfur reduces the energy gap of MoS2 quantum dots
    to 1.85 eV.
  instruction:
  - Construct a hexagonal MoS2 quantum dot with armchair edges and sulfur passivation
    (72 atoms, as shown in Figure 1b of the paper). Again, precise coordinates are
    not available
  - 'DFT setup in Gaussian 16: - Functional: M06-2X - Basis set: LANL2DZ - SCF convergence
    criterion: 10^-4'
  - Optimize the structure fully
  - Calculate the electronic density of states (DOS)
  - Extract the energy gap from the DOS
  - 'Expected result: 1.85 eV'
- claim: MoS2 quantum dots show a change in hydrogen adsorption free energy of ~0.007
    eV on surface sulfur sites.
  instruction:
  - Use the optimized pristine MoS2 quantum dot structure (from the first claim)
  - Add a hydrogen atom at different adsorption sites (as shown in Figure 5a of the
    paper).  The exact distances are not specified, but the paper mentions an initial
    distance of 2 Å
  - 'DFT setup in Gaussian 16: - Functional: M06-2X - Basis set: LANL2DZ - SCF convergence
    criterion: 10^-4'
  - Optimize the structure with the adsorbed hydrogen
  - Calculate the adsorption energy for each site
  - Calculate the change in free energy (∆G) using the formula mentioned in the paper
    (details not fully provided in the paper, making precise reproduction challenging)
  - 'Expected result for surface sites (sites 3 and 4): ~0.007 eV'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: The binding energies (Eb) of the nanodots range from 5.6 to 5.9 eV.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: The exact energies of isolated atoms
    (Ex, Es) used in the binding energy calculation are not provided.'
- claim: The nanodots are thermally stable at 300 K.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: While the paper mentions ADMP simulations,
    the precise parameters and input files for these simulations are not provided,
    making it difficult to reproduce the thermal stability results.'
- claim: WS2 quantum dots have an energy gap of 2.6 eV, which decreases to 0.75 eV
    after edge sulfuration.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: Similar to the MoS2 claims, the precise
    initial structures are not provided, making it difficult to reproduce these results
    exactly.'
- claim: NbS2 quantum dots have a spin doublet state.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: While the claim is made, the specific
    spin configuration and setup used in the calculations are not detailed enough
    for reproduction.'
