claims:
  - claim: "Germanene is a semiconductor with zero band gap and linear band dispersion around the K point."
    instruction:
      - "1. Construct a Germanene monolayer unit cell with lattice constant a = 3.97 Å and Ge-Ge bond length 2.38 Å"
      - "Perform DFT calculations using SIESTA:
   - Basis set: Double-zeta plus polarization (DZP)
   - Exchange-correlation: Local Density Approximation (LDA) with Ceperly and Alder (CA) parameterization
   - Energy cutoff: 450 Ry
   - Force convergence: 0.02 eV/Å
   - Vacuum distance: 20 Å
   - K-points: 30x30x1 Monkhorst-Pack grid"
      - "Calculate the band structure along the high-symmetry path Γ-M-K-Γ"
      - "Expected result: Linear band dispersion around the K point crossing the Fermi level, indicating a zero band gap"

  - claim: "The band gap opening occurs in the presence of bias voltage. The band gap is increased linearly with increase of the bias voltage strength."
    instruction:
      - "1. Use the relaxed Germanene structure from the previous calculation"
      - "Apply a bias voltage (U) by adding ±U/2 to the on-site energies of the two Ge atoms in the unit cell within the tight-binding Hamiltonian"
      - "Calculate the band structure for different bias voltages (e.g., U = 0.025, 0.05, 0.1 eV)"
      - "Extract the band gap for each bias voltage"
      - "Expected result: A direct band gap opens at the K point, increasing linearly with the bias voltage"

  - claim: "The tight binding results for position of the two first peaks in the optical Infrared region is same with the DFT results."
    instruction:
      - "1. Use the relaxed Germanene structure and the tight-binding parameters from Table 1 in the paper"
      - "Calculate the optical dielectric function using the tight-binding model"
      - "Perform DFT calculations using SIESTA with a denser k-point grid (90x90x1) for optical calculations"
      - "Calculate the optical dielectric function using DFT"
      - "Compare the positions of the first two peaks in the infrared region from both tight-binding and DFT calculations"
      - "Expected result: The peak positions should be similar"

non_reproducible_claims:
  - claim: "The thermal conductivity and heat capacity increase with increasing the temperature due to the increasing of thermal energy of charge carriers and excitation them to the conduction bands."
    reason: "reason: practical_limits
explanation: While the general trend can be reproduced, precise quantitative reproduction of thermal conductivity and heat capacity requires extensive calculations and careful convergence tests, which are beyond the scope of a simple reproduction exercise."

  - claim: "Raman spectroscopy confirms N incorporation"
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: Requires experimental Raman measurements."

  - claim: "Device mobility increases by 20%"
    reason: "reason: practical_limits
explanation: Requires device fabrication and electrical measurements."
