claims:
  - claim: "The formation energy of a monovacancy in AA-stacked bilayer graphene is about 7.9 eV (LDA) / 7.4 eV (GGA)."
    instruction:
      - "1. Create a 6a × 3b × 3√2c orthorhombic supercell of AA-stacked bilayer graphene (144 atoms)"
      - "Remove one carbon atom from either layer to create a monovacancy"
      - "DFT setup in AIMPRO:
   - Exchange-correlation: LDA or PBE (GGA) functional
   - Basis set: pdpp with 22 independent Gaussian-based functions
   - k-points: 4×4×2 Monkhorst-Pack grid
   - Occupation scheme: First-order Methfessel-Paxton with kB = 0.01 eV"
      - "Relax atomic positions"
      - "Calculate formation energy relative to perfect AA-stacked bilayer graphene"
      - "Expected result: 7.94 eV (LDA) / 7.41 eV (GGA)"

  - claim: "The V6 mezzanine defect has a formation energy of 2.92 eV (LDA) / 2.86 eV (GGA) per vacancy in AA-stacked bilayer graphene."
    instruction:
      - "1. Create a 6a × 3b × 3√2c orthorhombic supercell of AA-stacked bilayer graphene (144 atoms)"
      - "Remove a hexagonal ring of six carbon atoms from one layer"
      - "Translate a ring of six atoms from the adjacent layer by half the interlayer separation towards the created vacancy"
      - "DFT setup in AIMPRO (same as monovacancy calculation)"
      - "Relax atomic positions, allowing the translated ring to expand and form bonds with both layers"
      - "Calculate formation energy relative to perfect AA-stacked bilayer graphene and divide by the number of vacancies (6)"
      - "Expected result: 2.92 eV/vacancy (LDA) / 2.86 eV/vacancy (GGA)"

    instruction:
      - "1. Create a 6a × 3b × 3√2c orthorhombic supercell of AA-stacked bilayer graphene (144 atoms)"
      - "Remove three neighboring atoms from each layer, creating trivacancies in registry"
      - "DFT setup in AIMPRO (same as monovacancy calculation)"
      - "Relax atomic positions, allowing the formation of five interlayer sp2 bonds"
      - "Calculate formation energy relative to perfect AA-stacked bilayer graphene and divide by the number of vacancies (6)"
      - "Expected result: 3.05 eV/vacancy (LDA) / 2.89 eV/vacancy (GGA)"

non_reproducible_claims:
  - claim: "Raman spectroscopy confirms N incorporation"
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: Requires experimental Raman measurements"

  - claim: "Device mobility increases by 20%"
    reason: "reason: practical_limits
explanation: Requires device fabrication and electrical measurements"
