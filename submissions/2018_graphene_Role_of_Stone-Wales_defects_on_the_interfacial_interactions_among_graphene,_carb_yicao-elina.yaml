claims:
  - claim: "The equilibrium interlayer spacing between CNT and graphene is 3.33 Å."
    instruction:
      - "1. Create a supercell containing an (8,8) CNT and a graphene sheet. The dimensions of the supercell are 9.88 × 29.92 × 46.00 Å³"
      - "DFT setup in Quantum Espresso:
   - Exchange-correlation: vdW-DF2 functional
   - Pseudopotentials: RRKJ ultrasoft pseudopotentials (from Quantum Espresso distribution)
   - K-points: Gamma point only
   - Kinetic energy cutoff: 30 Ry
   - Charge density cutoff: 240 Ry"
      - "Relax the structure (vc-relax)"
      - "Measure the interlayer spacing between the CNT and graphene"
      - "Expected result: 3.33 Å"

  - claim: "The interaction energy between (8,8) CNT and graphene is -1.61 eV/nm."
    instruction:
      - "1. Use the relaxed structure from the previous calculation"
      - "Calculate the total energy of the combined system (E_AB)"
      - "Calculate the total energy of the isolated CNT in the same supercell (E_A/AB)"
      - "Calculate the total energy of the isolated graphene sheet in the same supercell (E_B/AB)"
      - "Calculate the interaction energy using E_int(AB) = E_AB - E_A/AB - E_B/AB"
      - "Normalize the interaction energy by the length of the CNT (9.88 Å)"
      - "Expected result: -1.61 eV/nm"

  - claim: "The Young's modulus of pristine graphene is 1068 GPa."
    instruction:
      - "1. Create a supercell of pristine graphene"
      - "DFT setup in Quantum Espresso (same as above, but vc-relax for initial structure)"
      - "Apply a series of small strains (ε ∈ [-0.02, 0.02]) along the desired direction. For each strain value:
   - Rescale the atomic coordinates.
   - Relax the atomic positions while keeping the cell dimensions fixed.
   - Calculate the total energy"
      - "Fit a second-order polynomial to the energy-strain data"
      - "Calculate Young's modulus using Y = (1/V0) * (∂²E/∂ε²), where V0 is the equilibrium volume (V0 = abt, with t = 3.33 Å)"
      - "Expected result: 1068 GPa"

  - claim: "The Young's modulus of (8,8) CNT is 1032 GPa."
    instruction:
      - "1. Create a supercell of pristine (8,8) CNT"
      - "Follow steps 2-5 as in the calculation for graphene's Young's modulus, but use V0 = 2πrl0t, where r = 5.49 Å and t = 3.33 Å"
      - "Expected result: 1032 GPa"

non_reproducible_claims:
  - claim: "Raman spectroscopy confirms N incorporation"
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: Requires experimental Raman measurements."

  - claim: "Device mobility increases by 20%"
    reason: "reason: practical_limits
explanation: Requires device fabrication and electrical measurements."

  - claim: "The interaction energy between (8,8) CNT and graphene is ~−3.50 eV/nm (from Wang et al. 2015)."
    reason: "reason: data_unavailable
explanation: While the authors attempt to reproduce this result and find a discrepancy, the precise details of the original calculation are not available to fully resolve the difference."
