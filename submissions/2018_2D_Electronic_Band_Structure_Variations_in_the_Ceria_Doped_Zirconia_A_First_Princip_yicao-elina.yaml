claims:
  - claim: "The intrinsic band gap of ZrO2 of 5.70 eV reduces to 4.67 eV with the 2.08% Ce doping."
    instruction:
      - "1. Create a 2x2x1 supercell of the conventional 12-atom cubic unit cell of ZrO2 (48 atoms total)"
      - "Replace one Zr atom with a Ce atom (CeZr-1 model, 2.08% Ce doping)"
      - "DFT setup in CASTEP (Materials Studio 8.0):
   - Exchange-correlation: PBEsol functional
   - Pseudopotentials: Ultrasoft pseudopotentials
   - K-points: 3×3×3 Monkhorst-Pack grid
   - Energy cutoff: 400 eV"
      - "Relax atomic positions and cell parameters until forces < 0.01 eV/Å and stress < 0.02 GPa"
      - "Calculate the band structure"
      - "Apply a scissor operator to correct the band gap to match the experimental value of 5.70 eV for pure ZrO2"
      - "Expected result for CeZr-1: 4.67 eV (after scissor correction)"

  - claim: "The maximum band gap reduction of ZrO2 is observed at 6.25% Ce doping concentration, having the value of 4.38 eV."
    instruction:
      - "1. Create a 2x2x1 supercell of the conventional 12-atom cubic unit cell of ZrO2 (48 atoms total)"
      - "Replace three Zr atoms with Ce atoms (CeZr-3 model, 6.25% Ce doping)"
      - "DFT setup in CASTEP (Materials Studio 8.0):
   - Exchange-correlation: PBEsol functional
   - Pseudopotentials: Ultrasoft pseudopotentials
   - K-points: 3×3×3 Monkhorst-Pack grid
   - Energy cutoff: 400 eV"
      - "Relax atomic positions and cell parameters until forces < 0.01 eV/Å and stress < 0.02 GPa"
      - "Calculate the band structure"
      - "Apply a scissor operator to correct the band gap to match the experimental value of 5.70 eV for pure ZrO2"
      - "Expected result for CeZr-3: 4.38 eV (after scissor correction)"

  - claim: "The ZrO2 cell volume linearly increases with the increasing Ce doping concentration."
    instruction:
      - "1. Create supercells of ZrO2 with different Ce doping concentrations (CeZr-1 to CeZr-6 as described in the paper)"
      - "Perform DFT calculations as described in the previous claims"
      - "Extract the optimized cell volume for each structure"
      - "Plot cell volume vs. Ce doping concentration"
      - "Expected result: A linear increase in cell volume with increasing Ce concentration"

non_reproducible_claims:
  - claim: "The photo-response of the ZrO2 is modulated with Ce insertion, and two distinct modifications are observed in the absorption coefficient: an imaginary part of the dielectric function and conductivity."
    reason: "reason: practical_limits
explanation: While the optical properties calculations are described, the precise details for reproducing the spectra (e.g., frequency range, broadening parameters) are not provided, making precise reproduction difficult."

  - claim: "Experimentally, it is proven that Ce mixing with ZrO2 can lead to improved thermal stability at higher temperature, along with lowering thermal conductivity [11]."
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: This claim requires experimental validation."
