paper_title: Quantum ESPRESSO toward the exascale
paper_pdf: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.10502.pdf
identifier: '2104.10502'
claim_type: custom_code
code_url: http://www.quantum-espresso.org/download

claims:
- claim: QE-GPU v6.5 achieves a speedup of 1.4x to 4.6x compared to the CPU version
    for a set of benchmark calculations.
  instruction:
  - Obtain the benchmark input files from the Materials Cloud archive (https://archive.materialscloud.org/record/2021.121)
  - Compile Quantum ESPRESSO v6.5 with Intel compiler and MKL for CPU calculations
  - Compile QE-GPU v6.5 with PGI compiler and Intel MKL for GPU calculations
  - Run the benchmark calculations with pw.x on both CPU and GPU, using the appropriate
    MPI and OpenMP settings as described in the paper (MPI only for CPU, MPI and OpenMP
    for GPU, k-point parallelism)
  - Compare the wall times for each calculation to determine the speedup
  - 'Expected results: Speedup varies depending on the system size and calculation
    parameters, ranging from 1.4x for small systems to over 4x for larger systems,
    as shown in Figure 2 of the paper.  The specific speedup values for each benchmark
    are provided in Figure 2'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: QUANTUM ESPRESSO will be ready to run on Intel Ponte Vecchio GPUs when they
    appear on the market.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Requires access to Intel Ponte Vecchio
    GPUs, which were not publicly available at the time of the paper''s publication.'
- claim: Porting to AMD accelerated architectures is also ongoing.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: The paper mentions ongoing work on
    AMD GPUs but doesn''t provide specific results or instructions.'
- claim: Work on ARM vectorized (SVE instruction set) architectures is also ongoing.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: The paper mentions ongoing work on
    ARM architectures but doesn''t provide specific results or instructions.'
