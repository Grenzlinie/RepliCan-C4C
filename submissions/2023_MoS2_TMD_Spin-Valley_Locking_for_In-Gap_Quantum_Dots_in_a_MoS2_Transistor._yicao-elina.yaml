claims:
  - claim: "7L MoS2: CB minima at Q-points, K-points mixing 137 meV above (DFT calculations)"
    instruction:
      - "1. Construct a 7-layer MoS2 structure"
      - "Perform DFT calculations (the paper does not specify the code or parameters used)"
      - "Calculate the band structure"
      - "Determine the location of the conduction band minima (CBM) and the energy difference between the CBM at Q and K points"
      - "Expected result: CBM at Q-points, K-points mixing 137 meV above"

non_reproducible_claims:
  - claim: "g⊥ = 2.2 ± 0.2 (D1) and g⊥ = 8.1 ± 0.2 (D2)"
    reason: "reason: data_unavailable
explanation: These g-factors are extracted from experimental measurements of Zeeman-shifted spin-valley ground states in an out-of-plane magnetic field.  The raw data and precise experimental setup are not available to reproduce these values computationally."

  - claim: "g∥ = 0.8 ± 0.1 for both transitions D1 and D2"
    reason: "reason: data_unavailable
explanation: Similar to the out-of-plane g-factors, the in-plane g-factor is derived from experimental measurements of the Zeeman shift in an in-plane magnetic field.  The raw data is needed for reproduction."

  - claim: "2∆ = 138 ± 6 µeV (D2) and 2∆ = 93 ± 6 µeV (D1)"
    reason: "reason: data_unavailable
explanation: These values are extracted from experimental fits to the in-plane Zeeman shift data, which is not available."

  - claim: "Spin-orbit splitting in the conduction band of order 2∆SO ≈ 100 µeV"
    reason: "reason: data_unavailable
explanation: This value is estimated based on the experimental measurements and analysis, not directly from DFT calculations."

  - claim: "Pronounced Zeeman anisotropy with near-vanishing Zeeman shifts for in-plane magnetic fields"
    reason: "reason: data_unavailable
explanation: This is an experimental observation based on measuring Zeeman shifts at different magnetic field angles.  Reproducing this requires the experimental data."

  - claim: "Multiple resonances with splitting of order meV, parallel to the diamond edges"
    reason: "reason: data_unavailable
explanation: This observation from bias spectroscopy requires the experimental data to reproduce."

  - claim: "Dot radius at most between 1.88 nm to 4.1 nm"
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: This estimation is based on experimental observations and assumptions about the orbital splitting and dimensionality of the dot, not directly from DFT."

  - claim: "Tel = (150 ± 40) mK"
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: This is the experimentally determined electron temperature."
