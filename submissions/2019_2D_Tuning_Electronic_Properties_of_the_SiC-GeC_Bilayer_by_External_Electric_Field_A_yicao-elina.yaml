claims:
  - claim: "The SiC/GeC nanosheet was shown to have a direct bandgap of 1.90 eV."
    instruction:
      - "1. Create a 4x4x1 supercell of SiC (16 Si, 16 C) and a 4x4x1 supercell of GeC (16 Ge, 16 C)"
      - "Combine the two supercells to form a bilayer with an interlayer distance of 5.10 Å"
      - "DFT setup in VASP:
   - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional with Grimme D2 van der Waals correction
   - Pseudopotentials: PAW
   - K-points: 5x5x1 Monkhorst-Pack grid
   - Energy cutoff: 450 eV"
      - "Relax atomic positions and cell volume until energy convergence of 10^-6 eV/atom and forces < 0.01 eV/Å"
      - "Calculate the band structure"
      - "Expected result: Direct band gap of 1.90 eV"

  - claim: "The bandgap reduced monotonically from 1.90 to 0 eV and disappeared at −0.40 V/Å."
    instruction:
      - "1. Use the relaxed SiC/GeC bilayer structure from the previous calculation"
      - "Apply an electric field perpendicular to the bilayer, ranging from 0 to -0.40 V/Å"
      - "For each electric field value:
   - Perform a self-consistent field (SCF) calculation.
   - Calculate the band structure.
   - Extract the band gap"
      - "Expected result: The band gap decreases with increasing electric field strength, reaching 0 eV at -0.40 V/Å"

  - claim: "The optimized lattice parameters of SiC and GeC monolayers are 3.09 and 3.23 Å, and the bond lengths of Si-C and Ge-C are 1.79 and 1.86 Å, respectively."
    instruction:
      - "1. Create a unit cell of SiC and GeC monolayer"
      - "DFT setup in VASP:
   - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional
   - Pseudopotentials: PAW
   - K-points: Appropriate k-point grid (e.g., 15x15x1)
   - Energy cutoff: 450 eV"
      - "Relax atomic positions and cell volume until energy convergence of 10^-6 eV/atom and forces < 0.01 eV/Å"
      - "Extract the optimized lattice parameters and bond lengths"
      - "Expected results: SiC lattice parameter = 3.09 Å, GeC lattice parameter = 3.23 Å, Si-C bond length = 1.79 Å, Ge-C bond length = 1.86 Å"

non_reproducible_claims:
  - claim: "Our conclusions might give some theoretical guidance for the development and application of the SiC/GeC nanosheet."
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: This is a general statement about potential applications and not a specific computational result."

  - claim: "Our results may prove some applications in vdW-based ﬁeld-eﬀect transistors."
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: This refers to potential device applications and is not directly related to the DFT calculations."
