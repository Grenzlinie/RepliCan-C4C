claim_type: "pip_libraries"
claims:
- claim: The 100A and 111A facets interact the strongest with Pd, with binding energies
    of up to -0.36 kcal/mol/Å².
  instruction:
  - Build Pd and HKUST-1 slabs with 100A and 111A facets using the     method described
    in the paper and Supporting Information, including force field     parameterization
    for Pd and Cu.
  - Perform molecular dynamics simulations using LAMMPS with the OPLS force field     and
    the customized parameters. Relax the system to an energy tolerance of 0.0001.     Treat
    the palladium slab as a rigid body.
  - Calculate the interaction energy between the Pd and HKUST-1 slabs. Normalize     the
    interaction energy by the area of the Pd-MOF interface.
  - The expected normalized interaction energies for 100A and 111A are approximately     -0.341
    kcal/mol/Å² and -0.364 kcal/mol/Å², respectively.
- claim: The MOF withdraws electron density from the Pd, resulting in a total charge
    of +1.67 on the Pd.
  instruction:
  - Construct a 5x3x2 Pd system with the MOF ligand described in the     paper (Figure
    6).
  - Perform DFT relaxation using Quantum Espresso with the PBE functional and D3     dispersion
    correction. Use Γ-point only, a wavefunction cutoff of 40 Ry, and a     mixing
    β of 0.3.
  - Perform Bader population analysis using the code referenced in the paper (University     of
    Texas).
  - The expected total charge on the Pd system should be approximately +1.67.
- claim: Decreasing electron density inhibits hydrogen absorption, while extra electron
    density enhances it.
  instruction:
  - Create a periodic 3x3x4 unit cell system of Pd.
  - Vary the system charge between -3 and +3.
  - For each charge, minimize the system at hydrogen loadings of 35%, 50%, and     65%.
  - Calculate hydrogen absorption energy using equation (1) provided in the paper.
  - Observe the trend of absorption energy with respect to the system charge. The
    more negative the absorption energy is, the more enhanced the absorption is.
- claim: The lattice constant of the Pd crystal increases from a value around 3.76
    Å at 0% loading to a value around 3.96 Å at about 80% loading.
  instruction:
  - Create 5x3x2 blocks of Pd.
  - Vary hydrogen loading from 0% to 80% by populating octahedral and surface sites     (Figure
    4).
  - Perform DFT energy minimizations using Quantum Espresso with initial lattice     parameters
    of 3.889 Å and 4.025 Å.
  - Measure the relaxed lattice constant for each hydrogen loading.
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: Experimental studies have shown the existence of two distinct lattice constants
    at intermediate hydrogen loadings.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: The paper references experimental
    studies but doesn''t provide the data'
