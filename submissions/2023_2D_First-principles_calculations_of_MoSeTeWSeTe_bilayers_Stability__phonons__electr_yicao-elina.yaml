claims:
- claim: The 2H phases of MoSeTe and WSeTe are 76 meV and 380 meV per unit cell less
    stable than the 1T' phase, respectively.
  instruction:
  - Construct 1x1 unit cells of MoSeTe and WSeTe in both 2H and 1T' phases
  - Perform DFT calculations using FHI-aims with PBE functional and tight basis set
  - Use a k-point mesh of 15x15x1
  - Relax atomic positions until forces < 5.0e-3 eV/Å
  - Compare total energies of 2H and 1T' phases for each material
  - 'Expected results: MoSeTe 2H is 76 meV higher than 1T''; WSeTe 2H is 380 meV higher
    than 1T'''
- claim: 2H-MoSeTe/2H-WSeTe bilayer is by 550 meV per unit cell more stable than the
    2H-MoSeTe/1T′-WSeTe bilayer.
  instruction:
  - Construct 1x1 unit cells of 2H-MoSeTe/2H-WSeTe and 2H-MoSeTe/1T′-WSeTe bilayers
  - Perform DFT calculations using FHI-aims with PBE functional, tight basis set,
    and MBD for van der Waals interactions
  - Use a k-point mesh of 15x15x1
  - Relax atomic positions until forces < 5.0e-3 eV/Å
  - Compare total energies of the two bilayer structures
  - 'Expected result: 2H-MoSeTe/2H-WSeTe is 550 meV lower in energy'
- claim: MoSeTe has a direct band gap at the K point, while WSeTe has an indirect
    band gap with CBM at Q.
  instruction:
  - Construct 1x1 unit cells of MoSeTe and WSeTe monolayers in the 2H phase
  - Perform DFT calculations using FHI-aims with PBE functional and tight basis set,
    followed by HSE06 for band structure
  - Include spin-orbit coupling
  - Use a dense k-point mesh for band structure calculations
  - Analyze the band structure to determine the location of VBM and CBM
  - 'Expected result: MoSeTe direct gap at K; WSeTe indirect gap with CBM at Q'
- claim: 'The MoSeTe/WSeTe bilayer (CAS-2: AB stacking) has a type-II band alignment.'
  instruction:
  - Construct 1x1 unit cell of MoSeTe/WSeTe bilayer (CAS-2, AB stacking)
  - Perform DFT calculations using FHI-aims with PBE functional, tight basis set,
    and MBD for van der Waals interactions, followed by HSE06 for band structure
  - Include spin-orbit coupling
  - Use a dense k-point mesh for band structure calculations
  - Project bands onto atomic orbitals to determine the origin of VBM and CBM
  - 'Expected result: Type-II band alignment'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: Raman spectroscopy confirms N incorporation
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: Requires experimental Raman measurements.'
- claim: Device mobility increases by 20%
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Requires device fabrication and electrical
    measurements.'
- claim: The results suggest that the judicious selection of the atomic sequence and
    stacking helps to widen the scope of the low-dimensional materials by adding or
    enhancing properties for specific applications, e.g. for spintronics or valleytronics
    devices.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: This is a qualitative claim about
    potential applications.'
