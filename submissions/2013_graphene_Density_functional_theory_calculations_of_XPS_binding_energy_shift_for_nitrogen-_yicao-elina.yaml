claims:
  - claim: "The binding energy (BE) shift for nitrogen bound to a metal (Co) in a graphene-like structure is approximately 1 eV with respect to pyridinic nitrogen."
    instruction:
      - "1. Structure setup:
   - Create a 32-atom graphene supercell (dimensions not explicitly stated, but likely a 4x4 or similar size).
   - Introduce N and Co atoms as substitutional defects, replacing C atoms.  Three different Co-N bonding environments are considered (Me-N4, Me-N2 (1), Me-N2 (2)) as shown in Figure 2 of the paper"
      - "DFT Calculation Setup (VASP):
   - Functional: GGA (specific functional not mentioned, likely PBE)
   - Pseudopotentials: PAW (Projector Augmented Wave)
   - K-points: Up to 12x12x1 (converged k-point grid)
   - Energy cutoffs: Not specified.
   - Dipole correction: Applied perpendicular to the graphene sheet.
   - Vacuum layer: 14 Å"
      - "Calculation:
   - Calculate the N 1s core-level binding energy for each structure (pristine graphene with pyridinic N, and the three Co-N structures) using the final state approximation.
   - BE = BE(N 1s) - EF, where EF is the Fermi energy"
      - "Post-processing:
   - Calculate the BE shift as the difference between the BE of N in the Co-N structures and the BE of pyridinic N in pristine graphene"
      - "Expected result: BE shifts of approximately +1.1 eV, +0.8 eV, and +1.0 eV for the three Co-N structures, respectively, relative to pyridinic N.  The average experimental BE shift is reported as +0.9 to +1.1 eV"

non_reproducible_claims:
  - claim: "The ratio of Co–N4/Co–N2 changes from 0.5 under vacuum to 2 in the presence of O2/H2O."
    reason: "reason: data_unavailable
explanation: The specific details of the ambient pressure XPS experiment (pressure, temperature, exposure time, etc.) are not provided, making it difficult to reproduce the exact experimental conditions. Additionally, the precise curve-fitting procedure used to determine the Co-N4/Co-N2 ratio is not fully described."

  - claim: "Co–N4 centers are energetically more favorable for binding of oxygen than Co–N2 centers."
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: This claim is based on a reference to another study (reference 30), which is not analyzed here.  It's not clear from this paper alone how this claim was computationally validated."

  - claim: "Raman spectroscopy confirms N incorporation"
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: Requires experimental Raman measurements"
