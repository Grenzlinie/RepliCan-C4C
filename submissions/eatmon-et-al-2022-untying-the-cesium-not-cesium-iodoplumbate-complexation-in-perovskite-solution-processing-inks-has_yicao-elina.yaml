claims:
  - claim: "133Cs chemical shift for 0.02M CsI in DMF is 9.55 ppm."
    instruction:
      - "1. Prepare a 0.02M solution of CsI in DMF"
      - "Measure the 133Cs NMR spectrum"
      - "The observed chemical shift should be 9.55 ppm (relative to 10mM CsI in DMSO)"

  - claim: "Adding MA+I− to 0.02 M CsI in DMF caused a change in shift to 11.2 ppm."
    instruction:
      - "1. Prepare a 0.02M solution of CsI in DMF"
      - "Add MA+I− to the solution. The specific concentration of MA+I− added is not specified, but can be inferred from Scheme 1"
      - "Measure the 133Cs NMR spectrum"
      - "The observed chemical shift should be 11.2 ppm (relative to 10mM CsI in DMSO)"

  - claim: "Adding PbI2 to a 0.02M CsI solution in DMF results in a chemical shift of 9.4 ppm."
    instruction:
      - "1. Prepare a 0.02M solution of CsI in DMF"
      - "Add PbI2 to the solution. The specific concentration of PbI2 added is not specified, but can be inferred from Scheme 1"
      - "Measure the 133Cs NMR spectrum"
      - "The observed chemical shift should be 9.4 ppm (relative to 10mM CsI in DMSO)"

  - claim: "Cs+ favors “tight” bonding to PbI3− by 7 kcal/mol in DMF solution."
    instruction:
      - "1. Perform AIMD simulations at 300K with explicit DMF solvent to sample configurations of Cs+ and PbI3-"
      - "Select the closest three DMF molecules to the Cs-PbI3 complex"
      - "Perform DFT calculations at 0K with the selected DMF molecules using a hybrid functional"
      - "Compare the energy difference between "tight" and "loose" binding configurations as defined in the paper (Figure 5)"
      - "The energy difference should be approximately 7 kcal/mol in favor of "tight" binding"

  - claim: "MA+ favors “tight” bonding to PbI3− by 3 kcal/mol in DMF solution."
    instruction:
      - "1. Perform AIMD simulations at 300K with explicit DMF solvent to sample configurations of MA+ and PbI3-"
      - "Select the closest three DMF molecules to the MA-PbI3 complex"
      - "Perform DFT calculations at 0K with the selected DMF molecules using a hybrid functional"
      - "Compare the energy difference between "tight" and "loose" binding configurations as defined in the paper (Figure 5)"
      - "The energy difference should be approximately 3 kcal/mol in favor of "tight" binding"

non_reproducible_claims:
  - claim: "207Pb chemical shifts follow a trend as a function of added iodide, but only for alkali metal cations with the smallest ionic radii."
    reason: "reason: data_unavailable
explanation: While the trend is described, the precise numerical values for various concentrations of added iodide are not provided in the paper or supplementary information, making precise reproduction impossible.  Figure 2 is qualitative."

  - claim: "The higher 207Pb chemical shift for all cation halide species here is attributed to the 20-fold increase in concentration of ions in solution."
    reason: "reason: data_unavailable
explanation: While the paper describes this increase qualitatively, it does not provide the precise numerical shift values for a 20-fold increase in concentration across all species, preventing exact numerical reproduction."

  - claim: "Plots of the potential of mean force (PMF) of these cations in DMF as a function of distance to PbI3− show that Cs+ is stabilized through Coulombic interactions with the plumbate."
    reason: "reason: data_unavailable
explanation: While the PMF plot is shown in Figure 4, the raw numerical data or a parameterized function for the PMF are not provided, hindering independent reproduction of the plot and analysis."
