claims:
- claim: Armchair WS2 nanoribbons are semiconductors with band gaps close to 0.5 eV.
  instruction:
  - Construct an armchair WS2 nanoribbon with the desired width (e.g., N_a = 15, 20,
    25)
  - 'DFT setup in VASP: - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional - Pseudopotentials:
    Projector augmented-wave (PAW) - K-points: 1x81x1 Monkhorst-Pack grid - Energy
    cutoff: 400 eV - Vacuum space: 20 Ã… in two perpendicular directions'
  - Relax atomic positions
  - Perform a self-consistent field (SCF) calculation
  - Calculate the band structure
  - 'Expected results: Band gaps of approximately 0.468 eV (15-WS2), 0.498 eV (20-WS2),
    and similar for 25-WS2'
- claim: Fe-doped ribbons can have two-channel conduction in the middle segment of
    the ribbon and at the edges, carrying opposite spins separately.
  instruction:
  - Construct a 15-WS2 nanoribbon
  - Substitute a central W atom with Fe
  - DFT setup in VASP (same as above, but spin-polarized)
  - Relax atomic positions
  - Perform a spin-polarized SCF calculation
  - Calculate the spin-polarized band structure
  - Analyze the spin density distribution
  - 'Expected result: Two bands crossing the Fermi level, one with majority spin localized
    around Fe and neighboring W, and another with minority spin localized at the edges'
- claim: Many Co-doped ribbons are transformed into spin filters that exhibit 100%
    spin-polarized conduction.
  instruction:
  - Construct a 15-WS2, 20-WS2, or 25-WS2 nanoribbon
  - Substitute a central W atom with Co
  - DFT setup in VASP (same as above, but spin-polarized)
  - Relax atomic positions
  - Perform a spin-polarized SCF calculation
  - Calculate the spin-polarized band structure
  - 'Expected result: For Co-15-WS2, Co-20-WS2, and Co-25-WS2, only majority spin
    bands cross the Fermi level'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: These results will be useful for spintronics and nanoelectronic circuit design.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Requires device fabrication and testing,
    beyond the scope of DFT calculations.'
