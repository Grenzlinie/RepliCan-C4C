claims:
- claim: d-GeC monolayer exhibits an indirect band gap of 1.73 eV (PBE) and 2.53 eV
    (HSE06).
  instruction:
  - Construct a d-GeC monolayer unit cell (12 atoms). The paper does not explicitly
    provide atomic coordinates, but mentions it is similar to d-BN and d-ZnO.  Further
    investigation into similar structures may be required to build the initial structure
  - 'DFT setup in VASP: - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional - Pseudopotentials:
    PAW - K-points: 12x12x1 for self-consistent calculations, 20x20x1 for density
    of states - Energy cutoff: 500 eV - vdW correction: Grimme D2'
  - Relax atomic positions and lattice parameters until forces < 0.01 eV/Å and energy
    change < 10^-5 eV
  - Calculate band structure along high-symmetry path (not explicitly given in the
    paper, requires further investigation based on the hexagonal Brillouin zone)
  - For HSE06 calculation, repeat steps 2-4 using the HSE06 hybrid functional
  - Extract VBM and CBM energies to determine the band gap
  - 'Expected results: PBE = 1.73 eV, HSE06 = 2.53 eV'
- claim: The equilibrium lattice constant (a = b) of the d-GeC monolayer is 8.93 Å.
  instruction:
  - Follow steps 1-3 from the band gap calculation instruction
  - After relaxation, extract the optimized lattice constant
  - 'Expected result: a = b = 8.93 Å'
- claim: The estimated Ge–C bond lengths are in the range of 1.840–1.95 Å.
  instruction:
  - Follow steps 1-3 from the band gap calculation instruction
  - After relaxation, measure the Ge-C bond lengths within the unit cell
  - 'Expected result: Bond lengths within the range of 1.840-1.95 Å'
- claim: Cohesive energy (Ecoh) for the d-GeC monolayer is 4.59 eV per atom.
  instruction:
  - Calculate the total energy of the relaxed d-GeC unit cell (Ed-GeC)
  - Calculate the total energy of isolated Ge (EGe) and C (EC) atoms
  - 'Use the formula: Ecoh = (6EGe + 6EC − Ed-GeC)/12'
  - 'Expected result: 4.59 eV/atom'
- claim: Formation energy (EFE) is -3.11 eV per atom.
  instruction:
  - Calculate Ed-GeC as in the cohesive energy calculation
  - Calculate the chemical potentials of Ge (mGe) and C (mC) from the per-atom energies
    of germanene and graphene, respectively
  - 'Use the formula: EFE = (Ed-GeC − 6mGe − 6mC)/12'
  - 'Expected result: -3.11 eV/atom'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: The d-GeC monolayer can serve as a good membrane for molecular and atomic
    permeation due to its low value of estimated diffusion energy barriers.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: While the paper mentions diffusion
    energy barriers were calculated using CI-NEB, the specific initial and final configurations
    for each molecule/atom are not provided, making it impossible to reproduce these
    calculations without further information.'
- claim: The d-GeC monolayer is thermally stable at 300K
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: While AIMD simulations were performed,
    the exact supercell size and simulation time are not clearly specified, making
    precise reproduction challenging. Additionally, reproducing AIMD simulations can
    be computationally demanding.'
