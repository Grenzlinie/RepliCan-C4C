claims:
  - claim: "The edge formation energy (Eedge) increases from 101.02 meV to 287.93 meV/edge atom as the length of the zigzag edge (nzig) increases from 1 to 12."
    instruction:
      - "1. Construct NZE-3NVGNRs with varying nzig from 1 to 12.  Ensure the width decreases as nzig increases, as described in the paper's model"
      - "Perform geometry optimization using GAMESS with the PBE/GGA functional and 6-31G(d,p) basis set. Include empirical dispersion correction"
      - "Calculate Eedge using equation (1) from the paper:
   Eedge = (Erib - NC * EC - NH * μH - NN * μN) / Nedge
   where Erib is the total energy of the nanoribbon, NC is the number of C atoms, EC is the total energy of graphene per atom, NH is the number of H atoms, μH is the chemical potential of H atoms, NN is the number of N atoms, μN is the chemical potential of N atoms, and Nedge is the number of edge atoms.
   Obtain chemical potentials (μH and μN) as described in the "Computational" section of the paper"
      - "Expected results are listed in Table 1 of the paper"

  - claim: "The binding energy (BE) per Scandium atom along the edge increases as nzig increases."
    instruction:
      - "1. Construct NZE-3NVGNRs with varying nzig and a Sc atom functionalizing the 3NV defect"
      - "Perform geometry optimization using GAMESS with the PBE/GGA functional and 6-31G(d,p) basis set. Include empirical dispersion correction and use DFT semi-core pseudopotentials for Sc"
      - "Calculate BE per Sc atom using equation (2) from the paper:
   BE = (Erib+Sc - Erib - NSc * μSc) / NSc
   where Erib+Sc is the total energy of the Sc-functionalized nanoribbon, Erib is the total energy of the pristine nanoribbon, NSc is the number of Sc atoms, and μSc is the chemical potential of a Sc atom (obtained from a large Sc96 cluster calculation)"
      - "Expected results are listed in Table 1 of the paper"

  - claim: "The HOMO-LUMO gap (Egap) increases as nzig increases."
    instruction:
      - "1. Use the relaxed structures from the previous BE calculation"
      - "Perform single-point energy calculations using GAMESS with the B3LYP-D functional (as GGA underestimates band gaps) and 6-31G(d,p) basis set"
      - "Extract the HOMO and LUMO energies from the output"
      - "Calculate Egap as the difference between LUMO and HOMO energies"
      - "Expected results are listed in Table 1 of the paper"

  - claim: "The adsorption energy (Eads) of the first H2 molecule increases as nzig increases."
    instruction:
      - "1. Construct Sc/NZE-3NVGNR structures with varying nzig"
      - "Add one H2 molecule to the Sc adsorption site"
      - "Perform geometry optimization using GAMESS with the PBE/GGA functional and 6-31G(d,p) basis set. Include empirical dispersion correction and BSSE correction"
      - "Calculate Eads using equation (3) from the paper with n=1"
      - "Expected results are listed in Table 1 of the paper"

non_reproducible_claims:
  - claim: "The Sc/NZE-3NVGNR system can achieve a hydrogen storage capacity exceeding 9.70 wt%."
    reason: "reason: practical_limits
explanation: While the paper calculates Eads for up to 5 H2 molecules per Sc, achieving this high loading in a real system and confirming it experimentally is beyond the scope of a typical computational reproduction."

  - claim: "Molecular dynamics simulations show the Sc/NZE-3NVGNR system is stable at room temperature."
    reason: "reason: data_unavailable
explanation: The specific parameters and setup for the MD simulations are not provided in sufficient detail to reproduce them precisely."

  - claim: "An applied electric field can modulate the H2 adsorption energy."
    reason: "reason: data_unavailable
explanation: The details of how the electric field is applied in the calculations are not provided."
