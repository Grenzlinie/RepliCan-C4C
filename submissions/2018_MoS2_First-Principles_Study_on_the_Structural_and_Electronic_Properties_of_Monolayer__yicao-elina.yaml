non_reproducible_claims:
  - claim: "The existence of vacancies can weaken the stiffness and strength of the MoS2 sheet."
    reason: "reason: data_unavailable
explanation: While the paper provides values for Young's modulus and ultimate tensile strength for defective MoS2, the raw stress-strain data for V1S and V2S are not available, making it difficult to precisely reproduce the weakening effect."

  - claim: "The strains also have a huge impact on the band gap of defected MoS2 sheets because of the relaxation near the vacancy."
    reason: "reason: data_unavailable
explanation: The paper presents the band gap variation with strain for defective MoS2, but the precise numerical data for each strain step are not provided, hindering precise reproduction."
