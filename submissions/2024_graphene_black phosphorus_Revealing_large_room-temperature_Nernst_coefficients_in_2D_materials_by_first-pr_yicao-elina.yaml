claims:
  - claim: "Trilayer graphene with ABA stacking exhibits an exceptionally large Nernst coefficient of 112 μV (KT)^-1 at room temperature."
    instruction:
      - "1. Construct an ABA-stacked trilayer graphene structure"
      - "Perform DFT calculations using Quantum Espresso (version 7.1):
   - Exchange-correlation: Engel-Vosko functional
   - Pseudopotentials: Projector augmented wave method (PAW)
   - Van der Waals correction: DFT-D
   - Relax atomic positions to minimum energy"
      - "Calculate transport properties using ElecTra and NERTAW codes:
   - Obtain necessary inputs (bulk and shear moduli, dielectric constant, phonon frequency, band gap, and deformation potentials) from literature or calculate using DFT.
   - Use maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWF) as implemented in Wannier90.
   - Consider electron-phonon and ionized impurity scattering mechanisms in ElecTra.
   - Calculate Nernst coefficient using NERTAW with a magnetic field of 0.4 T and temperature of 300 K"
      - "Expected result: ~112 μV (KT)^-1.  The paper does not provide an uncertainty"

  - claim: "Monolayer graphene exhibits a maximum Nernst coefficient of 40 μV (KT)^-1 at room temperature."
    instruction:
      - "1. Construct a monolayer graphene structure"
      - "Follow steps 2-4 from the previous claim, adapting the structure to monolayer graphene"
      - "Expected result: ~40 μV (KT)^-1. The paper does not provide an uncertainty"

  - claim: "ABC-stacked trilayer graphene exhibits a maximum Nernst coefficient of 35 μV (KT)^-1 at room temperature."
    instruction:
      - "1. Construct an ABC-stacked trilayer graphene structure"
      - "Follow steps 2-4 from the first claim, adapting the structure to ABC-stacked trilayer graphene"
      - "Expected result: ~35 μV (KT)^-1. The paper does not provide an uncertainty"

  - claim: "AAA-stacked trilayer phosphorene exhibits a maximum Nernst coefficient of 44 μV (KT)^-1 at room temperature."
    instruction:
      - "1. Construct an AAA-stacked trilayer phosphorene structure (armchair configuration)"
      - "Follow steps 2-4 from the first claim, adapting the structure to AAA-stacked trilayer phosphorene"
      - "Expected result: ~44 μV (KT)^-1. The paper does not provide an uncertainty"

non_reproducible_claims:
  - claim: "Experimental carrier mobility of monolayer graphene agrees with theoretical results."
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: Requires experimental measurements of carrier mobility."

  - claim: "Graphite hole mobility decreases with increasing temperature."
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: Requires experimental measurements of hole mobility at different temperatures."

  - claim: "Electron mobility of AB stacked bilayer graphene decreases with increasing carrier concentration."
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: Requires experimental measurements of electron mobility at different carrier concentrations."

  - claim: "Mobility of p-type single layer phosphorene decreases with increasing temperature."
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: Requires experimental measurements of p-type mobility at different temperatures."

  - claim: "Nernst coefficient of bulk black phosphorus is 15 μV (KT)^-1 at room temperature."
    reason: "reason: data_unavailable
explanation: The paper cites a previous study for this value, but the specific conditions (magnetic field, carrier concentration) are not provided."
