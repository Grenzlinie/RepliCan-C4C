claims:
- claim: The energy barrier between F2F and brick-wall configurations for short C-6
    ligands in vacuum is extremely high (1356 kcal mol⁻¹). The barrier drops non-linearly
    and dramatically to 387, 329 and 209 kcal mol⁻¹ as the ligand length increases
    to C-9, C-12 and C-15, respectively.
  instruction:
  - Perform thermodynamic integration (TI) calculations using LAMMPS as described
    in section 2.2.1
  - Set up a three-nanocube system as illustrated in Fig. 1, varying ligand lengths
    from C-6 to C-15
  - Run simulations in vacuum
  - Extract the free energy barrier between face-to-face and brick-wall configurations
    from the TI calculations
  - Expected free energy barrier values are approximately 1356, 387, 329, and 209
    kcal mol⁻¹ for C-6, C-9, C-12, and C-15 ligands, respectively
- claim: For C-6 and C-9 ligand lengths in toluene, the change in barrier is largest
    in C-6 (a change of 284 kcal mol⁻¹), compared to C-9 (a change of 48 kcal mol⁻¹).
    For C-12, the peak in free energy is smaller in toluene compared to vacuum (a
    change of -75 kcal mol⁻¹).
  instruction:
  - Perform thermodynamic integration (TI) calculations using LAMMPS as described
    in section 2.2.1
  - Set up a three-nanocube system as illustrated in Fig. 1, varying ligand lengths
    from C-6 to C-12
  - Run simulations in toluene solvent using TraPPE-UA force field
  - Extract the free energy barrier between face-to-face and brick-wall configurations
    from the TI calculations
  - Compare the barrier heights with corresponding vacuum simulations
  - Expected changes in barrier height are approximately -284, -48, and -75 kcal mol⁻¹
    for C-6, C-9, and C-12 ligands, respectively
- claim: In SMD simulations of the three-nanocube system in vacuum, the top nanocube
    rotates by a maximum of 11–12°.
  instruction:
  - Perform steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations using LAMMPS as described
    in section 2.2.2
  - Set up a three-nanocube system with C-9 ligands as shown in Fig. 1
  - Use a pulling speed of 0.25 nm ns⁻¹
  - Monitor the rotation angle of the top nanocube relative to the bottom two
  - Expected maximum rotation angle is between 11 and 12 degrees
