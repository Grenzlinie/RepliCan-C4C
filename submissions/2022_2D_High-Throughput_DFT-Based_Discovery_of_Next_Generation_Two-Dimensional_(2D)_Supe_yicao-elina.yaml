claims:
  - claim: "Monolayer Mg2B4N2 has a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 21.8 K."
    instruction:
      - "1. Obtain the relaxed structure of monolayer Mg2B4N2 from JARVIS-DFT (JVASP-153112)"
      - "Perform electron-phonon coupling (EPC) calculations using Quantum Espresso:
   - Exchange-correlation: PBEsol functional
   - Pseudopotentials: GBRV
   - K-points: Use converged k-point grid from JARVIS-DFT (check Table S2 in supplementary material)
   - Q-points:  Use converged q-point grid from JARVIS-DFT (check Table S2 in supplementary material)
   - Plane-wave cutoff: 45 Ry (610 eV)
   - Broadening: 0.68 eV (0.05 Ry)"
      - "Calculate Tc using the McMillan-Allen-Dynes formula with Î¼* = 0.1"
      - "Expected result: 21.8 K (Note: Paper mentions convergence checks in supplementary material, suggesting possible small variations depending on precise parameters)"

  - claim: "Monolayer W2N3 has a Tc of 18.7 K."
    instruction:
      - "1. Obtain the relaxed structure of monolayer W2N3 from JARVIS-DFT (JVASP-153122)"
      - "Follow steps 2 and 3 from the previous claim, adapting k- and q-point grids as needed (see Table S2)"
      - "Expected result: 18.7 K"

  - claim: "Monolayer NbO2 has a Tc of 17.5 K."
    instruction:
      - "1. Obtain the relaxed structure of monolayer NbO2 from JARVIS-DFT (JVASP-31356)"
      - "Follow steps 2 and 3 from the first claim, adapting k- and q-point grids as needed (see Table S2)"
      - "Expected result: 17.5 K"

  - claim: "2H-NbSe2 has a Tc of 6.4 K (calculated) and 8.3 K (experimental)."
    instruction:
      - "1. Obtain the relaxed structure of monolayer 2H-NbSe2 from JARVIS-DFT (JVASP-655)"
      - "Follow steps 2 and 3 from the first claim, adapting k- and q-point grids as needed (see Table S2)"
      - "Expected calculated result: 6.4 K"
      - "For experimental validation: Perform zero-field-cooled magnetometry measurements on layered 2H-NbSe2 with a magnetic field strength of 0.01 T.  Extract Tc from the susceptibility vs. temperature curve. Expected experimental result: ~8.3 K"

non_reproducible_claims:
  - claim: "Device applications of 2D superconductors."
    reason: "reason: practical_limits
explanation: Requires device fabrication and characterization, beyond the scope of DFT calculations."

  - claim: "Improved superconducting properties of monolayer FeSe compared to bulk FeSe."
    reason: "reason: data_unavailable
explanation: While the paper discusses this qualitatively and provides calculations for monolayer FeSe, the bulk FeSe calculations with magnetic ordering (necessary for accurate comparison) are not provided."

  - claim: "Tip-induced superconductivity in ZrSiS."
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: Requires specialized experimental setup and is not a direct output of standard DFT calculations."
