claims:
  - claim: "CO adsorption energy on SiGe monolayer is -0.24 eV at the center site (C down)."
    instruction:
      - "1. Create a 4x4 supercell of SiGe monolayer (32 atoms)"
      - "Place a CO molecule above the center site with the C atom pointing downwards"
      - "DFT setup in DMol3:
   - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional
   - Pseudopotentials: ultrasoft
   - K-points: 21x21x1 Monkhorst-Pack grid
   - Basis set: DNP
   - Global orbital cutoff radius: 5.0 Å
   - vdW correction: Grimme custom method"
      - "Relax atomic positions until forces < 0.05 eV/Å"
      - "Calculate adsorption energy: E_ad = E_SiGe+gas - E_SiGe - E_gas"
      - "Expected result: -0.24 eV"

  - claim: "NH3 adsorption energy on SiGe monolayer is -0.62 eV at the Ge site (N down)."
    instruction:
      - "1. Create a 4x4 supercell of SiGe monolayer (32 atoms)"
      - "Place an NH3 molecule above the Ge site with the N atom pointing downwards"
      - "DFT setup in DMol3 (same as above)"
      - "Relax atomic positions until forces < 0.05 eV/Å"
      - "Calculate adsorption energy: E_ad = E_SiGe+gas - E_SiGe - E_gas"
      - "Expected result: -0.62 eV"

  - claim: "SO2 adsorption energy on SiGe monolayer is -0.78 eV at the Si site (S down)."
    instruction:
      - "1. Create a 4x4 supercell of SiGe monolayer (32 atoms)"
      - "Place an SO2 molecule above the Si site with the S atom pointing downwards"
      - "DFT setup in DMol3 (same as above)"
      - "Relax atomic positions until forces < 0.05 eV/Å. Note: Si atom will deform and SO2 will become almost parallel to the SiGe plane"
      - "Calculate adsorption energy: E_ad = E_SiGe+gas - E_SiGe - E_gas"
      - "Expected result: -0.78 eV"

non_reproducible_claims:
  - claim: "The external electric field can effectively modify the adsorption strength."
    reason: "reason: practical_limits
explanation: While the paper provides qualitative trends, precise quantitative reproduction of the electric field effect requires further specifications of the field strength and direction, and careful convergence tests."

  - claim: "The I-V curves of NH3 adsorption were also investigated."
    reason: "reason: practical_limits
explanation: Reproducing the I-V curves requires using the NEGF method, which is not fully specified in the paper.  Details about the NEGF implementation and parameters are missing."

  - claim: "SiGe monolayer is a promising candidate for gas sensing applications."
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: This is a qualitative assessment based on the computational results and requires experimental validation."
