claims:
- claim: 2D SnC is a semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 1.24 eV (without SOC)
    and 1.07 eV (with SOC).
  instruction:
  - Create a unit cell of 2D SnC with a = b = 3.551 Å and c = 16 Å
  - 'DFT setup in Quantum Espresso: - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional - Pseudopotentials:
    Troullier-Martins norm-conserving - K-points: 50 k-points using Monkhorst-Pack
    scheme - Energy cutoff: 1000 eV - Convergence threshold: 1.0e-6 eV'
  - Calculate the band structure with and without spin-orbit coupling (SOC)
  - Extract the indirect band gap from the band structure
  - 'Expected results: 1.24 eV (without SOC), 1.07 eV (with SOC)'
- claim: 2D NbC is a conductor.
  instruction:
  - Create a unit cell of 2D NbC with a = b = 4.101 Å and c = 16 Å
  - DFT setup in Quantum Espresso (same parameters as for SnC)
  - Calculate the band structure with and without SOC
  - Observe the absence of a band gap around the Fermi level
- claim: The electrical conductivity of 2D SnC is 1.00076e3 S/m (without SOC) and
    1.01395e3 S/m (with SOC).
  instruction:
  - Use the calculated band structures from the previous SnC calculation
  - Use Wannier90 to calculate the electrical conductivity using the Boltzmann transport
    equation with a constant relaxation time
  - 'Expected results: 1.00076e3 S/m (without SOC), 1.01395e3 S/m (with SOC)'
- claim: The electrical conductivity of 2D NbC is 1.09530e4 S/m (without SOC) and
    1.2942e4 S/m (with SOC).
  instruction:
  - Use the calculated band structures from the previous NbC calculation
  - Use Wannier90 to calculate the electrical conductivity using the Boltzmann transport
    equation with a constant relaxation time
  - 'Expected results: 1.09530e4 S/m (without SOC), 1.2942e4 S/m (with SOC)'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: Optical absorption and reflectivity spectra for 2D SnC, 2D NbC, and graphene.
  reason: 'reason: data_unavailable explanation: While the paper presents the spectra,
    the raw data or precise numerical values are not provided, making precise reproduction
    difficult. The paper mentions using the random phase approximation and Kramers-Kronig
    relations, but specific parameters and scripts are not detailed.'
- claim: 3D SnC has an electrical conductivity of 1.32e4 S/m.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: This is an experimental value cited
    from another source and not calculated in this paper.'
- claim: 3D NbC has an electrical conductivity of 1.35e6 S/m.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: This is an experimental value cited
    from another source and not calculated in this paper.'
