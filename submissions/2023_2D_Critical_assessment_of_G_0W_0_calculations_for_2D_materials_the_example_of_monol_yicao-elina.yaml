claims:
  - claim: "LDA, PBE, and HSE underestimate the S-S bond length in monolayer MoS2, with PBE being closest to the experimental value."
    instruction:
      - "1. Perform ground state DFT calculations for monolayer MoS2 using LDA, PBE, and HSE functionals"
      - "Relax atomic positions until forces are smaller than 10 μHa/bohr"
      - "Extract the S-S bond length (dSS) from the relaxed structure"
      - "Compare the calculated dSS values with the experimental value"
      - "Expected results (from Table 1): LDA (3.106 Å), PBE (3.125 Å), HSE (3.101 Å). Experimental value (3.172 Å for bulk MoS2)"

  - claim: "G0W0@HSE, using the PBE geometry and including spin-orbit coupling, yields a direct band gap of 2.68 eV for monolayer MoS2, in good agreement with the experimental value of 2.6 eV."
    instruction:
      - "1. Obtain the relaxed PBE geometry for monolayer MoS2 (a = 3.186 Å, dSS = 3.125 Å from Table 1)"

non_reproducible_claims:
  - claim: "Experimental band gap for free-standing MoS2, determined by photocurrent spectroscopy, is 2.5 eV."
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: Requires experimental measurements."

  - claim: "The measured value for freestanding MoS2 hole effective mass is mh = (0.43 ± 0.02)m0."
