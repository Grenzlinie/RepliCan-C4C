claims:
- claim: Bilayer GeSe and GeSe/SnSe heterostructure are dynamically stable, while
    bilayer SnSe is dynamically unstable.
  instruction:
  - Construct bilayer GeSe, GeSe/SnSe heterostructure, and bilayer SnSe in AA stacking
  - 'Perform structural relaxation using VASP with: - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional
    - PAW pseudopotentials - Kinetic energy cutoff: 600 eV - K-points: 12x12x1 Monkhorst-Pack
    grid - DFT-D2 van der Waals correction - Convergence criteria: Energy < 10^-6
    eV/atom, Force < 0.001 eV/Å'
  - 'Calculate phonon dispersion using PHONOPY with: - 5x5x1 supercell - 3x3x1 k-point
    mesh'
  - Check for imaginary frequencies in the phonon dispersion. Absence of imaginary
    frequencies indicates dynamical stability
- claim: Bilayer GeSe and GeSe/SnSe heterostructure are indirect band gap semiconductors
    with band gaps of 1.23 eV and 1.07 eV, respectively (HSE06).
  instruction:
  - Use the relaxed structures from the previous calculation
  - 'Perform electronic structure calculation using VASP with: - Exchange-correlation:
    HSE06 hybrid functional - PAW pseudopotentials - Kinetic energy cutoff: 600 eV
    - Denser k-point mesh (e.g., 25x25x1) for accurate band structure'
  - Calculate band structure along high-symmetry path
  - Extract band gap values from the band structure
- claim: n-type bilayer GeSe along the armchair direction has a peak ZT of 1.95 at
    700 K.
  instruction:
  - Use the relaxed structure of bilayer GeSe
  - Perform electronic structure calculation using VASP with a dense k-point mesh
    (e.g., 25x25x1)
  - 'Calculate transport properties using BoltzTraP with: - Constant relaxation time
    approximation (τ = 10 fs) - Rigid band approximation'
  - Calculate lattice thermal conductivity using the Slack model
  - Calculate ZT as a function of carrier concentration and temperature
  - Extract the peak ZT value for n-type doping along the armchair direction at 700
    K
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: The SnSe/GeSe nanosheet heterojunction has been successfully prepared in
    the experiment by Sun et al. in 2017.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: Requires experimental synthesis
    and characterization.'
- claim: Device mobility increases
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Requires device fabrication and measurements,
    beyond the scope of DFT calculations.'
