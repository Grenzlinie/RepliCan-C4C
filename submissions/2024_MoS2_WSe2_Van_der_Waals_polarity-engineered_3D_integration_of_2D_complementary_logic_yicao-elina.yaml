claims:
- claim: CrOCl-interfaced MoS2 turns from n-type to p-type.
  instruction:
  - Create a MoS2/CrOCl heterostructure.  The exact number of layers for each material
    isn't specified for this claim, but the paper uses few-layer structures (3-10
    layers).  A 3 MoS2 layer + 3 CrOCl layer heterostructure is explicitly mentioned
    for a later calculation
  - 'DFT setup in VASP: - Exchange-correlation: PBE for MoS2, DFT+U for CrOCl - Pseudopotentials:
    Projector augmented wave (PAW) - K-points:  12x12x1 for individual layers, 6x1x1
    for heterostructure (Gamma-centered) - Energy cutoff: 600 eV - vdW correction:
    DFT+D2 - U value: 3.0 eV for Cr - Magnetic configuration: Antiferromagnetic for
    CrOCl'
  - Relax atomic positions until forces < 0.01 eV/Å
  - Calculate charge density difference between electron-doped and neutral MoS2, both
    with and without the CrOCl interface
  - Calculate band structure for MoS2, CrOCl, and the MoS2/CrOCl heterostructure
  - 'Expected result: Charge transfer from MoS2 to CrOCl, resulting in p-type behavior
    in MoS2 when interfaced with CrOCl.  Band alignment should show MoS2 VBM close
    to CrOCl CBM under negative electric field'
- claim: Work function of CrOCl is larger than that of MoS2.
  instruction:
  - Create 10-layer MoS2 and 5-layer CrOCl structures
  - Use the same DFT setup as the previous claim (VASP, PBE/DFT+U, etc.)
  - Relax the structures
  - Calculate the work functions
  - 'Expected result: CrOCl work function > MoS2 work function.  The paper states
    the CBM of MoS2 is ~0.465 eV above the CBM of CrOCl in the absence of an electric
    field'
- claim: MoS2–CrOCl hybrid exhibits a maximum room-temperature hole mobility reaching
    approximately 425 cm²/V s, with on/off ratio exceeding 10⁶.
  instruction:
  - This claim is based on experimental measurements and cannot be directly reproduced
    with DFT calculations.  The DFT calculations support the underlying mechanism
    of p-type doping, but device performance depends on many factors beyond the scope
    of DFT
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: Raman spectroscopy shows blue-shifted A1g and E2g1 modes in MoS2–CrOCl.
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: Requires experimental Raman measurements.'
- claim: Vertically constructed complementary logic, including inverters with 6 vdW
    layers, NANDs with 14 vdW layers and SRAMs with 14 vdW layers, are demonstrated.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Requires device fabrication and electrical
    measurements, not solely DFT calculations.'
- claim: Device shows minimal degradation within 12 months at room temperature in
    air.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Requires long-term experimental testing.'
- claim: Contact resistance is 8.8 kΩ μm.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Requires device fabrication and TLM
    measurements.'
