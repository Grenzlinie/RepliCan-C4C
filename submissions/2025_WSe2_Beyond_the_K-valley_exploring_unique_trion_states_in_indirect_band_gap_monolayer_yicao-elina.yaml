claims:
  - claim: "The conduction band minimum (CBM) is found at the Q-valley, halfway along the Γ-K direction, 82 meV higher than the K-valley."
    instruction:
      - "1. Perform a DFT calculation for monolayer WSe2"
      - "DFT setup in Quantum Espresso:
   - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional
   - Pseudopotentials: Fully-relativistic, norm-conserving pseudopotentials
   - Plane wave cutoff: 60 Ry
   - Out-of-plane cell length: 50 Bohr
   - Van der Waals correction: DFT-D3-BJ"
      - "Relax the atomic structure"
      - "Calculate the band structure along the Γ-K path"
      - "Extract the CBM energy at the K and Q points"
      - "Expected result: CBM at Q is 82 meV higher than at K"

  - claim: "The spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induced spin-splitting in the valence band is ~455 meV."
    instruction:
      - "1. Follow steps 1-4 from the previous claim"
      - "Extract the valence band maximum (VBM) energies at the K point for both spin channels"
      - "Calculate the difference between the two VBM energies"
      - "Expected result: ~455 meV"

  - claim: "The A exciton has a binding energy of 480 meV."
    instruction:
      - "1. Perform a many-body calculation using the screened configuration interaction method described in the "Methods" section of the paper"
      - "Use the DFT wavefunctions and energies from the previous calculations as input"
      - "Calculate the absorption spectrum for excitons (X, QCOM = 0)"
      - "Extrapolate the results to infinitely dense k-samplings"
      - "Identify the energy of the first bright exciton (A)"
      - "Calculate the binding energy as the difference between the IP gap and the A exciton energy"
      - "Expected result: 480 meV"

non_reproducible_claims:
  - claim: "The results are in excellent agreement with experimental data."
    reason: "reason: data_unavailable
explanation: Experimental data is not provided in the paper or a publicly accessible repository."

  - claim: "An additional peak ~13 meV below the A−K,S state is observed experimentally."
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: This is an experimental observation, not a computational claim."

  - claim: "The recombination of the A−K,S and A−Q,T states within the same valley results in light emission polarized in the same direction."
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: This claim relates to the polarization of emitted light, which requires further experimental validation."
