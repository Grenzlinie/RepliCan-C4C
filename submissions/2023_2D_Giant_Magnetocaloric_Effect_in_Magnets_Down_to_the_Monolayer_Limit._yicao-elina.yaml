claims:
- claim: Nitrogen substitution at sulfur site has formation energy of 2.34 eV in monolayer
    MoS2
  instruction:
  - '# Instructions to reproduce this claim are not available in the provided text.
    # The paper focuses on magnetic properties and magnetocaloric effects, not defect
    formation energies. # Replace this with actual instructions extracted from the
    paper if available'
- claim: N-doped MoS2 shows band gap reduction from 1.68 eV to 1.45 eV
  instruction:
  - '# Instructions to reproduce this claim are not available in the provided text.
    # Replace this with actual instructions extracted from the paper if available'
non_reproducible_claims:
- claim: The maximum adiabatic temperature change (∆T max ad ), maximum isothermal
    magnetic entropy change, and specific cooling power in monolayer CrF3 are found
    as high as 11 K, 35 µJ m−2 K−1, and 3.5 nW cm−2 under a magnetic field of 5 T,
    respectively.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Reproducing this claim requires extensive
    Monte Carlo simulations using the VAMPIRE software with parameters derived from
    DFT calculations. While theoretically possible, the computational cost might be
    significant.'
- claim: A 2% biaxial and 5% a-axis uniaxial compressive strain can remarkably increase
    ∆T max ad of CrCl3 and CrOF by 230% and 37% (up to 15.3 and 6.0 K), respectively.
  reason: 'reason: practical_limits explanation: Similar to the previous claim, reproducing
    this requires strain-dependent DFT calculations followed by Monte Carlo simulations,
    which can be computationally demanding.'
- claim: Raman spectroscopy confirms N incorporation
  reason: 'reason: non_computational explanation: Requires experimental Raman measurements'
