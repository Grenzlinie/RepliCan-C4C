claims:
  - claim: "Cyclohexane possesses slightly larger adsorption energy on pristine MoS2 and Janus MoSSe monolayers than acetone without external electric fields."
    instruction:
      - "1. Prepare 4x4 supercells of MoS2 and Janus MoSSe monolayers with 15 Å vacuum along the c-axis"
      - "Place acetone and cyclohexane molecules in various orientations (Acev1, Acev2, Aceh, Parallel) on the monolayers"
      - "DFT setup in VASP:
   - Exchange-correlation: PBE functional
   - PAW method
   - Kinetic energy cutoff: 520 eV
   - K-points: 4x4x1 Gamma-centered Monkhorst-Pack grid
   - Dipole corrections perpendicular to the monolayers
   - Van der Waals correction: Grimme D3"
      - "Relax atomic positions until forces < 0.01 eV/Å"
      - "Calculate adsorption energy: E_ads = E_VOC/TMD - E_VOC - E_TMD"
      - "Expected results (without electric field):
   - Cyclohexane on MoS2: -0.39 eV
   - Cyclohexane on MoSSe-S: -0.36 eV
   - Cyclohexane on MoSSe-Se: -0.37 eV
   - Acetone (Aceh) on MoS2: -0.36 eV
   - Acetone (Aceh) on MoSSe-S: -0.32 eV
   - Acetone (Aceh) on MoSSe-Se: -0.35 eV"

  - claim: "The adsorption energy of acetone shows the most substantial enhancement on the Janus MoSSe monolayer [under external electric fields]."
    instruction:
      - "1. Use the relaxed structures from the previous calculation"
      - "Apply external electric fields from -0.6 to +0.6 V/Å using the "EFIELD" tag in VASP INCAR. Include dipole corrections (IDIPOL and LDIPOL)"
      - "Calculate adsorption energies for acetone in different orientations on both MoS2 and MoSSe under varying electric fields"
      - "Expected results (see Table 2 in the paper):  The adsorption energy of acetone (Acev2) on MoSSe-S increases to -0.85 eV under +0.6 V/Å, showing a substantial enhancement compared to other cases"

  - claim: "The adsorption energy of cyclohexane on Janus MoSSe monolayer can be enhanced from -0.36 eV to -0.72 eV under external electric fields."
    instruction:
      - "1. Use the relaxed structures of cyclohexane on MoSSe from the first claim's instructions"
      - "Apply external electric fields from -0.6 to +0.6 V/Å (similar to the previous claim)"
      - "Calculate adsorption energies for cyclohexane on MoSSe under varying electric fields"
      - "Expected results (see Table 3 in the paper): The adsorption energy of cyclohexane on MoSSe-S increases to -0.72 eV under +0.6 V/Å"

non_reproducible_claims:
  - claim: "Desorption temperatures analysis (using MKMCXX)"
    reason: "reason: data_unavailable
explanation: The specific input parameters and setup for the microkinetic simulations using MKMCXX are not provided in detail."

  - claim: "Raman spectroscopy confirms N incorporation"
    reason: "reason: non_computational
explanation: Requires experimental Raman measurements."
