claims:
- claim: The initial minute of heat treatment produces minimal impact on hardness;
    however, there was a sharp decrease (by 30%) after 2-minutes.
  instruction:
  - Perform heat treatments on ZX10 magnesium alloy samples at 450°C for 1 minute
    and 2 minutes
  - Measure Vickers hardness using a LECO AMH55 Hardness Tester with a 200 gf load.
    Average at least ten measurements for each sample
  - Calculate the percentage decrease in hardness from the 1-minute sample to the
    2-minute sample
  - 'Expected result: Approximately 30% decrease in hardness'
- claim: The corrosion rate experienced a rapid decline (40%) within the ﬁrst minute
  instruction:
  - Perform a heat treatment on a ZX10 magnesium alloy sample at 450°C for 1 minute
  - Conduct a 24-hour immersion bio-corrosion test in Earle’s Balanced Salt Solution
    at 5% CO2 and 37.1°C
  - Calculate the corrosion rate using equation (3) in the paper
  - Compare the corrosion rate of the heat-treated sample to the as-received (ECAP)
    sample
  - 'Expected result: Approximately 40% decrease in corrosion rate'
- claim: ECAP sample has a high dislocation density exceeding 3 × 10^15 m^-2 but drops
    tenfold after just a one-minute exposure to 450°C
  instruction:

    SRM 660 (LaB6) for instrumental profile function
  - Calculate dislocation density as described in Section 2.2 and using the CMWP program
  - 'Expected result: Dislocation density in ECAP sample > 3 × 10^15 m^-2, and a tenfold
    decrease after 1-minute annealing'
- claim: Within the initial minute of exposure at 450°C, the overall precipitate fraction
    decreased by approximately 30%.
  instruction:
  - Perform XRD analysis on ECAP sample and 1-minute annealed sample
  - Calculate precipitate volume fraction using equation (1) in the paper
  - 'Expected result: Approximately 30% decrease in overall precipitate fraction after
    1-minute annealing'
- claim: ECAP samples exhibited highly reﬁned grains, averaging approximately 800
    nm in size... grain size increased signiﬁcantly by 60-fold, reaching nearly 50
    μm towards the end of the process (128 hours).
  instruction:
  - Perform optical microscopy on ECAP sample and 128-hour annealed sample
  - Measure grain sizes using the intercept method as described in ASTM E112-13
  - 'Expected result: Average grain size of ~800nm for ECAP sample, and ~50μm for
    the 128-hour annealed sample'
- claim: LASSO regression fit has an accuracy of 93.14% for hardness
  instruction:
  - Implement LASSO regression using PyTorch as described in Section 2.5.1
  - Use equation (11) and physics-informed features
  - Perform LOOCV for model selection and hyperparameter tuning
  - 'Expected result: R^2 score of 0.9314 for the hardness prediction'
- claim: LASSO regression fit has an accuracy of 81.16% for corrosion rate
  instruction:
  - Implement LASSO regression using PyTorch as described in Section 2.5.1
  - Use equation (15) and physics-informed features
